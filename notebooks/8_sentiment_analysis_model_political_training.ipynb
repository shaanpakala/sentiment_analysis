      "Voters swung hard toward the Republicans in late September, suggesting the Democrats’ summer surge is waning as the midterm elections approach, according to a new poll from Monmouth University.In the survey, the Democrats saw their standing in the generic ballot shrink from a 50% to 43% lead over the Republicans in August to a 47% to 44% deficit last month, with more respondents preferring Republican control of Congress. The poll ran from Sept. 21-25. The survey also found economic concerns trumping abortion, with 82% saying inflation was their top priority and 68% saying jobs and unemployment were most important, compared to 56% who said the same about abortion.Concern about the loss of federal protections for abortion rights in the wake of the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization ruling was a big driver in the Democrats’ improvement in the polls in late August and early September. Data from the latest Monmouth Poll suggest that rise has subsided, reverting to a political atmosphere that would be expected to produce substantial Republican gains. r\n",

I have not made that formal decision, but it’s my intention – my intention to run again. And we have time to make that decision,” Biden told MSNBC’s Jonathan Capehart in an interview at Delaware State University in Dover. The question of Biden’s political future will be front-and-center for Democrats after November’s midterm elections, in which the party is fighting to keep control of Congress. Already, the President’s responses to whether he will mount another bid for the White House have injected questions into the developing 2024 race.\n",

In remarks at the White House less than three weeks before the midterm elections, the President touted a $1.4 trillion decline in the federal deficit and discussed what he sees as dire fiscal consequences if Republicans regain majorities in Congress. The GOP, Biden argued, will “threaten the very foundations of the American economy if we don’t meet their demands.” “They will crash the economy next year by threatening the full faith and credit of the United States for the first time in our history, putting the United States in default unless we yield to their demand to cut Social Security and Medicare,” he said. “Let me be really clear. I will not yield. I will not cut Social Security. I will not cut Medicare, no matter how hard they work at it.”\n",

Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett rejected a challenge to the program brought by a Wisconsin taxpayers group. And on the same day, a federal district court judge rejected a separate lawsuit brought by six Republican-led states. Student loan cancellations, worth up to $20,000 per eligible borrower, could show up on borrowers’ accounts as soon as Sunday. Lawyers for the government agreed in court documents to hold off on discharging any debt before October 23 as it faces several legal challenges. The appeal at issue in the Supreme Court case was considered an uphill battle because lower courts had ruled that the group, the Brown County Taxpayers Association, did not have the legal right or “standing” to bring the challenge. Under normal circumstances, taxpayers don’t have a general right to sue the government over how it uses taxpayer funds.\n",

Patel spent several hours throughout the morning of October 13 before a grand jury at the US courthouse in Washington, DC. But it’s not clear if Patel answered the grand jury’s questions or declined to respond citing his Fifth Amendment protections, which is within his rights. He is one of a handful of advisers around Donald Trump after his presidency who could have legal risk related to the Mar-a-Lago situation, according to court records and the sources, though it’s unclear if he is a target of the Justice Department probe. Patel served as a national security and defense official during the administration, and this summer became one of Trump’s designees to interact with the National Archives and the Justice Department as both agencies have tried to repossess classified records Trump kept from his presidency.\n",

      "Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes was skeptical that then-President Donald Trump would invoke the Insurrection Act in the lead up to January 6, according to new messages revealed Thursday, and was privately preparing to wage his own rebellion led by the far-right militia group. Investigators obtained the new messages from Rhodes’ phone, many of which are from one of seven main Signal chats that the Oath Keepers used to coordinate around January 6, 2021. Prosecutors said that additional messages came from the electronic devices of other members of the Oath Keepers and from their phone providers – noting that T-Mobile preserved messages of some users. Rhodes had released two public letters calling on Trump to use the Insurrection Act, according to prosecutors. If Trump did invoke the act, he believed the former President would call upon the Oath Keepers as a militia to help stop what they saw as a stolen election and prevent Joe Biden from becoming president, according to the public letters. He echoed the same ideas in encrypted group messages with other members of the Oath Keepers, encouraging the group to organize a quick reaction force outside of Washington, DC, on January 6 in case they were called upon.\n",

Raphael Warnock is putting money behind the accusations that have roiled the key race. Warnock’s campaign released a new television ad on Thursday that highlight the allegations that Walker paid for a woman’s abortion and encouraged her to have another one. The Republican has repeatedly denied the accusations and CNN has not independently confirmed them. The ad, titled “Hypocrite,” contrasts those allegations with Walker’s support for abortion bans with no exceptions, something the Republican called for as recently as this summer.\n",

But the plan is dead for now, officials tell CNN, in part after the White House grew hesitant over the complicated logistics. It has been an endless cycle since President Joe Biden took office, according to multiple administration officials and sources close to the White House. Agency officials dream up a plan but then struggle to get White House approval, even as the problem compounds and Republicans step up their criticism.\n"

      "New Hampshire GOP Gov. Chris Sununu sat for an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on Wednesday night. The topic of election denialism – specifically related to New Hampshire Republican Senate nominee Don Bolduc – came up. Here’s the exchange: Tapper: Gov. Sununu, you’re a sane Republican at a time when a lot of people are looking for sane Republicans. Are you hurting the cause of sane Republicans when you embrace people like that? Sununu: No, look, this is about having folks in Washington, DC, that put New Hampshire first. Was the election stolen? Of course it wasn’t stolen. That’s nonsense, absolute nonsense, and it’s great to see him actually backtrack on that. But that isn’t the issue folks are going to vote on. Mar-a-Lago is not the issue folks are going to vote on.

The new disclosure from the Senate candidate comes more than five months after a near fatal stroke days before the May Democratic primary forced him off the trail. Even after his return to campaigning, Fetterman’s recovery has hung over his race against Republican candidate Mehmet Oz in what has become one of the most closely watched Senate contests in the country. The new report, written by Dr. Clifford Chen, comes following an October 14 visit to the doctor by the Democratic nominee. Chen wrote that while Fetterman “spoke intelligently without cognitive deficits,” he “continues to exhibit symptoms of an auditory processing disorder which can come across as hearing difficulty,” something the candidate has routinely acknowledged himself and is the reason he used closed captioning in interviews since his stroke.\n",

      "As pollsters and political professionals alike attempt to divine which issue – or issues – will drive the outcome of the midterm elections, the internal White House view of the current dynamics isn’t exactly hidden. President Joe Biden’s schedule this week provides the roadmap in a less than subtle, real-time triage effort to fire up Democrats and stanch political bleeding on the economy. His push this week in some ways demonstrates the limits of his power, both on the policy and the politics. He remains at the mercy of an increasingly fragile international economy, major ground war in Europe and a global oil market turned on its head by OPEC+ earlier this month. Major campaign rallies are virtually non-existent, with Democrats across battleground states and districts wary of Biden’s low approval numbers and choosing to take advantage of the President’s fundraising prowess instead. It’s a reality Biden’s advisers say he’s fairly sanguine about, given his five decades in politics. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in an MSNBC interview, may as well have spoken for Biden when she responded to Democrats calling for a change in leadership with the words made famous by former NFL owner Al Davis: “Just win, baby.”\n",

Beyond providing a venue for Demings to shift the political winds that until now appear to have favored Rubio, the debate may also be her last, best chance to convince her party that Florida is a worthwhile investment for its final push to maintain control of the US Senate. While national Democrats and their allies celebrated when Demings announced she would challenge Rubio, they have offered little by way of reinforcements ever since, leaving the three-term congresswoman to largely fend for herself against a seasoned campaigner and one of the Republican Party’s most recognizable figures. At a recent campaign stop in Tampa, Demings acknowledged the uphill climb she faces, telling CNN of the race, “Of course it’s hard, but it’s not impossible.” She said her own fundraising, which had surpassed Rubio by $20 million as of September 30, showed voters in Florida and around the country are “willing to stand up and fight for what they need, not just allow the same old broken record to be played over and over again, with pitiful results.”\n",

      "Requests for Barack Obama are pouring in from Democrats around the country – candidates are desperate for his help in what they feel is an existential midterms battle, one in which each race could help determine control of Congress and governments in the states. To these candidates, American democracy itself is on the line. And while Obama agrees with them on the stakes, many of those invitations are about to get turned down. More than a dozen advisers and others who have spoken with Obama say the former president’s approach in the fall campaign will remain limited and careful. That cautious approach comes as Obama tells people his presence fires up GOP opposition just as much as it lights up supporters, that he has more of an impact if he does less and that he can’t cloud out the up-and-coming generation of Democrats.\n",

      "The Trump Organization charged the Secret Service “exorbitant rates” – upwards of $1.4 million over four years – to protect the former President and his family at properties they owned, according to documents released by the House Oversight Committee on Monday. The committee found that the Trump Organization charged the Secret Service “excessive nightly rates on dozens of trips” as high as $1,185 per night despite claims by the former President’s company that federal employees traveling with him would stay at those properties “for free” or “at cost.” “The exorbitant rates charged to the Secret Service and agents’ frequent stays at Trump-owned properties raise significant concerns about the former President’s self-dealing and may have resulted in a taxpayer-funded windfall for former President Trump’s struggling businesses,” the panel’s chairwoman, New York Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney, wrote in a letter to the service’s director on Monday.\n",

      "The economy and inflation are the dominant issues three weeks out from the midterm congressional elections, challenging Democrats’ chances of maintaining control of Congress, according to a string of new polls released in the last few days. Widespread impressions of the economy as bad and worsening, combined with dissatisfaction with President Joe Biden and the way things are going in the country, suggest that the nation’s overall political mood – which had been somewhat more favorable for Democrats following the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade – may be tilting more in Republicans’ favor. A CBS News/YouGov survey released Sunday finds 65% of voters feel the economy is getting worse and 68% say the Biden administration could be doing more to combat inflation. In a New York Times/Siena College poll released Monday, 64% of likely voters say the United States is heading in the wrong direction, with the economy (26%) and inflation (18%) the only issues named by double-digit shares of likely voters as the most important problem facing the country today, with all other issues at 8% or less. And 70% of registered voters say they are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the US today, according to an AP-NORC survey out Monday, including majorities across party lines.\n"

      "After being outspent by Democrats all summer, supporters of Republican candidates in the 10 most competitive Senate races have dumped more than $365 million on TV and digital ads since the beginning of September to catch up. That financial gap is being filled by the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC affiliated with Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, according to data from AdImpact, an advertising tracking firm. With more than $196 million invested on the airwaves and online so far, the Senate Leadership Fund is by far the largest TV and digital advertiser this fall in six of the 10 states deemed most likely to flip by CNN — Georgia, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin. It’s hard to overstate the effect the super PAC has single-handedly made on advertising in the final two months of the elections. With its help, Republicans are outspending their Democratic rivals on ads in four of those 10 competitive races. But if not for the Senate Leadership Fund, Democrats would command the ad markets in every race but Florida, the most red-leaning of the 10 states. The Senate Leadership Fund has not spent any money on ads this fall for Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio.\n",

And it’s simple and it’s now. It’s easy,” Biden said in remarks from the White House alongside Education Secretary Miguel Cardona. “This is a game changer for millions of Americans … and it took an incredible amount of effort to get this website done in such a short time.” Individuals seeking to apply for student debt relief can now fill out the form in English or Spanish at Studentaid.gov. The form includes information on the debt relief, who qualifies for it and how it works. It asks applicants for information including their full name, Social Security number, date of birth, phone number and an email address. Borrowers have until December 31, 2023, to submit an application.\n",

In a statement to CNN, O’Dea, the CEO of a Colorado construction company, didn’t walk away from the criticism he’s been leveling at Trump, including on Sunday when he told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” that he would “actively” campaign against Trump and for other GOP candidates if the former President runs again. O’Dea also told Bash that Trump should have done more to prevent the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. “I’m a construction guy, not a politician,” O’Dea said in his statement to CNN. “President Trump is entitled to his opinion but I’m my own man and I’ll call it like I see it. Another Biden, Trump election will tear this country apart. DeSantis, Scott, Pompeo or Haley would be better choices.

Yet it’s the race for the US House that may be the more interesting one.

For reference, Republicans were ahead on the generic ballot at this point in the last two midterms when there was a Democratic president (in 2010 and 2014). If the current tie on the generic ballot holds in the vote for the House, control of the chamber would be a toss-up. Indeed, a number of people, including me, have noted the possibility of House Democrats maintaining their majority.\n"

Walker has denied the allegations, which have not been independently confirmed by CNN. With those allegations weighing on the Senate race, Democrats and Republicans alike view the debate as a potentially decisive hour, when both candidates will have a chance to sway the tiny sliver of remaining undecided voters.\n"

While history’s judgments take decades, it is already clear that the two terms of the first Black President triggered a backlash that has shaped America ever since. He was, after all, succeeded by Donald Trump, who got his political start by authoring a racist and false conspiracy theory that Obama was not born in the United States. The current conservative Supreme Court majority dragging the country to the right owes much to the refusal of Senate Republicans to grant Obama a pick for the top bench that was his constitutional prerogative. And from Obama’s landmark health care law to the Iran nuclear deal, Republicans spent much of the time since his presidency ended trying to undo his legacy.\n",

      "Americans’ views of President Joe Biden have rebounded slightly from their dismal outlook over the summer, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. But public assessment of the economy remains grim, and Americans remain largely unconvinced that Biden, Congress or the government as a whole are meaningfully addressing major issues facing the country. Biden’s overall job approval rating has recovered modestly from its worst summer doldrums: 44% of US adults approve, up from 38% in CNN’s June and July polling. Biden’s ratings have risen 9 percentage points among Democrats and 8 points among independents since that previous poll, with the President’s image also seeing particularly marked improvement among Black Americans (up 17 points) and adults younger than age 45 (11 points). Enthusiasm about Biden’s presidency, however, remains scarce, with around 15% of the public strongly approving of his overall job performance. By contrast, roughly 4 in 10 strongly disapprove. Just 22% of Americans rate economic conditions in the country as good, with 41% calling conditions somewhat poor, and another 37% saying they’re very poor. The percentage saying conditions are good is a slight uptick from 18% this summer. The public’s short-term outlook is somewhat more positive, with 40% expecting that economic conditions in the country will be good a year from now, and only 26% expecting them to remain very poor. That optimism is driven mostly by Democrats, 63% of whom expect economic conditions to improve to that level by next year. Most independents and Republicans, by contrast, expect conditions to remain poor over that time.\n",

      "In the final month of the midterm election season, Republican candidates have made crime central to their closing message. In Nevada, Republican Senate nominee Adam Laxalt is running an ad touting police groups who have flipped from endorsing his opponent, Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, in 2018 to him in 2022. In Wisconsin, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson has spent millions tying his Democratic challenger, Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, to efforts to defund the police and called him “dangerously liberal on crime.” And in gubernatorial contests in Pennsylvania and New York, GOP candidates and outside groups have used graphic crime video in campaign ads – including clips from outside the states they hope to represent. With control of Congress and governors’ mansions on the line, Republicans now are placing nearly as much emphasis on rising violent crime across the country as they have on the economy for over a year. This lasered-in focus has forced Democratic campaigns – many of which have spent the last few months focused on abortion as the dominant issue motivating voters – to defend their records and push back against Republicans’ leveraging of high-profile crimes against them.\n",

Officials said they expected the meeting to focus on determining where they could bolster support for Ukraine’s air defenses and the uncertain energy situation as winter approaches. After the meeting, G7 countries vowed to hold Russian President Vladimir Putin and those responsible accountable for the recent attacks in Ukraine. A joint statement from the group committed to support Ukraine for “as long as it takes,” while promising to continue to provide financial, humanitarian, military, diplomatic and legal support. “We are committed to supporting Ukraine in meeting its winter preparedness needs,” the statement said.\n"

Biden did announce an expedited review of how marijuana is scheduled under federal law – a move that could change how the drug is regulated in the United States and could help guide criminal laws.\n"

      "Charlie Crist, whose career as a Republican ended with a hug from a Democratic president, may have seen his political fate sealed by another Democratic president complimenting his Republican rival. That’s the sentiment rolling through Democratic circles in Florida after President Joe Biden’s tour of the state’s storm-ravaged Gulf Coast, where he praised Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, Crist’s opponent, for his handling of Hurricane Ian. Biden called DeSantis’ response “pretty remarkable” after a congenial joint event with his sometime nemesis. Hurricane Ian’s arrival a month before the election has pushed politics to the back burner as state and local leaders continue to deal with the fallout of the deadliest storm to hit Florida in generations. It has been a challenge for Democratic candidates to turn the attention back to the campaign trail with so much focus on the recovery and so many residents in southwest Florida homeless.\n",

      "President Joe Biden has signed a long-awaited classified policy tightening the rules for the CIA and the Pentagon to carry out deadly drone strikes and commando raids conducted outside of traditional war zones, US officials said on Friday. With only Iraq and Syria still considered by the US to be so-called areas of active hostilities – or conventional war zones – the new policy is geared toward countries like Somalia, Yemen and now, Afghanistan, where the US continues to carry out counterterrorism strikes from afar. In practice, the new policy signals that the US is limiting its reliance on drone strikes, once a ubiquitous counterterrorism tool that has drawn increased criticism in recent years in the wake of a series of high-profile revelations about civilian casualties.\n",

Their odds of keeping the Senate look better than they did earlier in the midterm cycle and there are even some pundits who suggest Democrats might be able to eke out a House majority. Here’s the thing that all of that happy talk misses: Biden is still not at all popular among the public. And if past is prologue, his approval ratings are the key to how his party will do in November.\n",

The US still has seen no evidence that Putin is moving toward using Russia’s nuclear capability, nor is there any intelligence showing he’s decided to do so. But Biden’s comments – laid out in starker terms than other US officials have used to date – reflected heightened concerns inside his administration about the risk of Russia carrying out a nuclear strike in Ukraine, where Russian forces have recently faced a string of defeats. Biden’s blunt assessment caught several senior US officials by surprise, largely due to that lack of any new intelligence to drive them and the grim language Biden deployed.\n",

Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a prominent voice in the Republican Party who voted to convict former President Donald Trump in his second impeachment trial, plans to resign from the Senate by the end of the year to take a job as the president of the University of Florida, according to a source familiar with the deliberations.

Sasse has made little secret of the frustration he felt with the Senate and the changing nature of the Republican Party. He explained his decision to vote to convict Trump by saying that the former President’s lies about the election “had consequences” and brought the country “dangerously close to a bloody constitutional crisis.” He was one of seven Republican senators to vote to convict Trump after the House of Representatives impeached him for incitement of an insurrection.\n",

Trump on Tuesday filed an emergency application to the court to step into his dispute with the Justice Department over documents marked classified that he hoarded at the resort in Florida.\n",

      "Former President Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Tuesday to intervene in the dispute over materials marked as classified that the FBI seized from his Mar-a-Lago estate this summer. His emergency request with the Supreme Court is the latest example of the former President seeking to involve the justices in investigations that entangle him – at a time when the high court’s legitimacy in politically explosive cases is under intense scrutiny. Trump is specifically asking the court to ensure that the more than 100 documents marked as classified are part of the special master’s review. The request, if granted, could bolster the former President’s attempt to challenge the search in court, as he has argued that he may have had a right, as a former president, to possess certain government documents, including documents potentially containing the country’s most sensitive secrets.\n",

Republican groups are publicly vowing to spend huge money to help Walker overcome the late controversy. But Republicans are privately acknowledging the report, which Walker has vehemently denied, could be a death blow – and are trying to limit the damage to his campaign. Walker campaign manager Scott Paradise addressed staff on Tuesday morning, telling aides that the allegation that Walker had paid for an abortion was a setback this close to the election, according to a source familiar with the remarks.\n"

      "Democrats in Wisconsin sought to turn the midterm elections into a referendum on abortion after Republicans who control the state legislature met for less than 30 seconds Tuesday to reject Gov. Tony Evers’ bid to allow voters to decide the issue. In a state where two of the nation’s most competitive races are playing out as Evers, the Democratic governor, and Republican Sen. Ron Johnson seek reelection, an 1849 law banning abortion in nearly all circumstances took effect following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn federal abortion rights protections this summer. The GOP-led legislature has defended the 1849 law and has not added exceptions for rape and incest. And Wisconsin’s law does not allow for referendums like the one on Michigan’s ballot in November that could allow voters there to overturn a decades-old abortion ban.\n",

The former Trump Organization attorney, Alex Cannon, had been working with Archives representatives since 2021 to facilitate the return of records that had been taken to Trump’s Florida residence and resort at the end of his presidency. Because Cannon was based in New York and had been assisting with the records matter from afar, he was unsure whether the Archives had received everything in Trump’s possession and thus refused the former President’s request, said people familiar with the matter. Trump told Cannon not to involve himself further, the sources said.

The latest public spat regarding the ongoing 2020 election investigation was revealed in court filings Monday by Fulton County prosecutors, who filed a motion to disqualify attorneys Holly A. Pierson and Kimberly Bourroughs Debrow, saying their “simultaneous” representation of 11 clients is “rife with serious ethical problems” and conflicts of interest that violate the Georgia state bar’s rules of professional conduct. In the new court filing, which is heavily redacted, the Atlanta-area district attorney’s office says that Pierson and Debrow should be prohibited “from any further participation in this matter” and that if they are “allowed to continue in their representation of even just one of the 11, there is a serious possibility of future ethical problems concerning confidentiality of information obtained in the course of their representation thus far.”\n"

      "The Department of Homeland Security is projecting between 9,000 to 14,000 migrants may attempt to cross the US southern border a day when a Trump-era border policy ends in late December, more than double the current number of people crossing, according to a source familiar with the projections. Officials are bracing for an influx of migrants trying to cross into the United States when the controversial public health authority, known as Title 42, ends in three weeks. Since March 2020, border authorities have been able to turn away migrants encountered along the border under Title 42. That will no longer be the case in late December, as authorities return to traditional protocols following a court order earlier this month that struck down the policy.\n",

      "A jury’s willingness to convict two leaders of a far-right militia of seditious conspiracy for plotting to forcibly oppose the government is a major vindication of how the Justice Department is approaching its investigation into the efforts to disrupt President Joe Biden’s 2020 win. As the Justice Department digs deeper into the conduct of former President Donald Trump and his inner circle, the conviction of two Oath Keepers leaders – as well as the conviction on another key charge brought against all five defendants – will be useful to building out a case around the plotting to overturn Trump’s loss that went beyond just the riot at the Capitol on January 6, 2021. The seditious conspiracy charge has both a scant track record and a loaded political meaning – making it a gamble for the Justice Department to bring in the January 6 investigation.\n",

President Joe Biden’s announcement of the move on Monday was as notable for its 506-word length and detailed, bordering on pained, explanation for the decision to implicitly buck close political allies as it was for the decision itself. The fierce pushback from the labor movement was expected, even if unwelcome, one official said. Similar concerns from Democratic allies on Capitol Hill were viewed as inevitable as the White House moved toward a course of action pursued 18 times in the past to prevent a rail shutdown and the sweeping economic fallout that would follow.

      "Donald Trump’s meeting with a Holocaust-denying extremist is finally drawing significant GOP criticism and casting doubt on his political viability following the tepid launch of his 2024 campaign. Some Republicans, albeit tentatively and often with self-protecting caveats, are beginning to test whether the political incentives for criticizing the ex-president could outweigh the hazards. This trend is obvious in reactions from ex-Vice President Mike Pence and some top lawmakers over Trump’s dinner at his Florida resort last week with White supremacist Nick Fuentes. It was also visible earlier this month in critiques of the ex-president after many of his election-denying, neophyte candidates flamed out in the midterm elections and suggested that he could again doom Republicans in a general election in 2024. At the same time, however, the growing clout of radical, pro-Trump members of the new House majority, which takes over in January – and the reality that GOP leader Kevin McCarthy’s hopes of being speaker may rely on Trump’s patronage – demonstrates his still robust influence. That dynamic was on show on Tuesday after McCarthy emerged from a meeting at the White House with congressional leaders and condemned Fuentes and his rhetoric, but misleadingly implied that Trump had also repeatedly condemned his guest as well.\n",

It’s sitting in front of the Senate. Does it have 60 votes in the Senate right now? Probably not. But let’s see if we can try to get that number is close to 60 as possible. If we don’t have the votes, then we’ll talk to [Senate Majority Leader Chuck] Schumer and maybe come back next year, with maybe an additional senator, and see if we can do better.” Murphy also said there needs to be a conversation in the US Senate about funding law enforcement in counties that are refusing to enforce state and national gun laws.\n",

      "House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who also sits on the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, said Sunday that he doesn’t believe the committee’s upcoming report would focus almost entirely on Donald Trump. Schiff, a California Democrat, told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union,” that he doesn’t believe a recent Washington Post story about how the contents of the report could potentially leave out investigations in other areas. “No, I mean – I certainly hope not,” Schiff said. “I would like to see our report be as broad and inclusive as possible. We are discussing as a committee among the members what belongs in the body of the report, what belongs in the appendices of the report, what is beyond the scope of our investigation, and we’ll reach those decisions in a collaborative manner.”\n",

Unlike the 2021 runoffs, control of the Senate is not on the line, with Democrats having won 50 seats already and Vice President Kamala Harris giving the party a tie-breaking vote. However, the stakes remain high: A Warnock victory would give Democrats the majority outright, rather than requiring the power-sharing agreement that is now in place. Democrats would have the majority on committees, allowing them to advance President Joe Biden’s nominees more easily.\n",

But the country is contending with a new set of complex challenges this late fall and winter. Even though Covid tests as well as an updated booster are largely accessible and Thanksgiving holiday travel nearly returned to pre-pandemic levels, a slew of pressures on the global economy and a recent surge in respiratory illnesses are expected to continue to impact on Americans in the coming months, leaving President Joe Biden with the challenge of addressing how to quell national anxieties over matters sometimes outside of the executive branch’s control. The latest data from the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index shows American consumers are still not feeling very confident about the state of the US economy this holiday season. Concerns remain, for example, about high costs across spending categories associated with the holidays, despite some moderation in inflation.\n",

It has no social redeeming value, zero, none. Not a single, solitary rationale for it,” Biden told reporters during a brief gaggle outside the Nantucket Fire Department in Massachusetts, where he greeted first responders. Asked whether he would try to take action on guns, the president said, “I’m going to try. I’m going to try to get rid of assault weapons.” When pressed on whether he would try to do so during the lame duck session, he said, “I’m going to do it whenever – I’ve got to make that assessment as soon as I get in and start counting the votes.”\n"

Hardline Republicans – who have been agitating to impeach President Joe Biden or a member of his Cabinet – sounded off on McCarthy in a group chat and expressed deep concern over his comments, according to GOP sources familiar with the internal conversations. But two weeks after the elections, where Republicans underperformed and won a slimmer-than-expected majority that has put McCarthy’s House speaker bid at risk, McCarthy struck a different tone: he called on Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to resign, accused him of lying to the American public and not enforcing immigration laws, and threatened to launch an impeachment inquiry if he doesn’t step aside.

The former president absorbed a stunning defeat at the Supreme Court over his long-running campaign to hide his tax returns, which are now set to land before a Democratic-run House committee. Republican-appointed appeals court judges, meanwhile, appeared cool to his latest bid to slow the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case. A New York judge set an October 2023 trial date for the state’s $250 million case alleging fraud against Trump, three of his children and his organization, which will fall just before Republican presidential primary season. And as the hangover lingers from his false claims of fraud in 2020, Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham testified to a Georgia grand jury probing the ex-president’s alleged election stealing bid. Given Trump’s massive legal exposure, and habit of using the courts’ deliberative pace to postpone accountability, it’s not unusual for him to have a tough time on the same day in simultaneously running cases.\n",

He does remain a force to be reckoned with in GOP circles, and the news that the Justice Department has appointed a special counsel to oversee investigations related to the former president could elicit a rally-around-Trump effect among Republicans. Nevertheless, it’s clear his power within the party has diminished following the 2022 midterm elections. The easiest way to tell that Trump’s standing isn’t what it once was is to look at the reaction to his 2024 presidential announcement. Many Republican elected officials and conservative media personalities gave it a big yawn.\n",

Wade say the newly declared 2024 contender will still have to earn their support in the upcoming Republican presidential primary – and he may be off to a rocky start.

Within hours, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, a leading anti-abortion group, released a statement pointedly dismissing candidates “who shy away from this fight.” Though the group did not mention Trump by name, its message was clear: No matter what he did to advance the anti-abortion cause during his first term, he must continue to prove his commitment as he seeks a second term or risk losing some conservative coalition support.\n",

Smith’s experience ranges from prosecuting a sitting US senator to bringing cases against gang members who were ultimately convicted of murdering New York City police officers. In recent years, Smith has prosecuted war crimes at The Hague. His career in multiple parts of the Justice Department, as well as in international courts, has allowed him to keep a relatively low-profile in the oftentimes brassy legal industry. His experience and resume will allow him, at least at first, to fly underneath the type of political blowback that quickly met former special counsel Robert Mueller’s team. It also shows he is adept at managing complex criminal cases related to both public corruption and national security – and that he has practice making challenging decisions with political implications.\n",

      "The House select committee investigating January 6, 2021, on Wednesday pushed back on former Vice President Mike Pence’s recent comments that Congress has “no right” to his testimony and that he was “closing the door” on it. “The Select Committee has proceeded respectfully and responsibly in our engagement with Vice President Pence, so it is disappointing that he is misrepresenting the nature of our investigation while giving interviews to promote his new book,” said Reps. Bennie Thompson and Liz Cheney, who serve as the panel’s chair and vice chair, in a joint statement. “The Select Committee has consistently praised the former Vice President’s refusal to bow to former President (Donald) Trump’s pressure to illegally refuse to count electoral votes on January 6th. But his recent statements about the Select Committee are not accurate,” they added.\n",

      "A day after Donald Trump announced his third bid for the presidency, he faced public defections from billionaire backers and vicious trolling from a once-friendly New York tabloid – underscoring his early challenges in mounting a political comeback nearly two years after the end of his divisive presidency. Stephen Schwarzman, the CEO of the private equity firm Blackstone and a one-time Trump ally, announced Wednesday that he would not support Trump’s bid for the Republican nomination, saying it’s time “for the Republican party to turn to a new generation of leaders.” A spokesman for another billionaire supporter – cosmetic heir Ronald Lauder – confirmed to CNN on Wednesday that Lauder would not back Trump’s bid to become only the second US president elected to two nonconsecutive terms.\n",

Ron DeSantis, already a master at sidestepping questions about his political future, is proving equally adept at tiptoeing around Donald Trump as he builds a case for his party’s nomination in 2024. As Trump staged the unveiling of a third presidential campaign, DeSantis in public and behind closed doors this week has avoided directly responding to the former president – or even mentioning him by name – while still drawing sharp contrasts between the two Republican figures. Speaking in Lee County on Wednesday, DeSantis called for people asking about his brewing rivalry with Trump to “chill out a little bit.” He then pivoted immediately to touting his own performance in last week’s midterm elections compared to the “substandard performance” of the GOP in the rest of the country, where Trump’s involvement has become the focal point of many Republicans’ recriminations.\n",

The fact that the GOP finally passed the threshold of 218 seats needed for control of the chamber eight days after Election Day – and that it came down to the final districts to report results – underscores the party’s underwhelming midterm election performance, which history and political logic suggested should have delivered a heftier rebuke to Biden and Democrats. In defiance of political gravity, Democrats held onto the Senate after an election dominated by concerns about high inflation and influenced, in some places, by the Supreme Court’s overturning of a constitutional right to abortion this summer. There’s still an outstanding Senate race in Georgia, which will be decided by a December runoff and will determine how large Democrats’ majority will be.\n",

The trip – spanning Egypt, Cambodia and Indonesia for summits focused on climate, Southeast Asia and the global economy – came at a tricky moment, challenging the president to balance his attention on both ongoing domestic political battles and the international matters in front of him. Biden, for instance, would be thousands of miles away from Washington as votes continued to be tabulated in midterm races across the country. He would be in Indonesia while his 2020 competitor and predecessor, former President Donald Trump, announced his third run for the presidency in Florida. And through it all, Biden would try to thread the needle of diplomacy with allies and adversaries who might not know if his brand of foreign policy would stick around for the long term.\n",

      "A New York judge threw out Mary Trump’s lawsuit against former President Donald Trump, saying her claims are barred by an earlier settlement she reached more than 20 years ago. Mary Trump, the former president’s niece, had alleged in the lawsuit that she was defrauded of millions of dollars in a 2001 family settlement. In 2020, Mary Trump sued Donald Trump; his sister Maryanne Trump Barry, a retired judge; and the executor of her late uncle Robert Trump’s estate, alleging “they designed and carried out a complex scheme to siphon funds away from her interests, conceal their grift, and deceive her about the true value of what she had inherited.”\n"

      "Washington Republicans are in an uproar hours ahead of Donald Trump’s expected launch of a new presidential run, exacerbated by the party’s protracted wait for the House majority it will use to try to weaken President Joe Biden. Trump apparently plans to open the 2024 election cycle at his Mar-a-Lago resort Tuesday evening, despite the failure of his election-denying acolytes in the midterms and unusual ambivalence among GOP lawmakers over his prospects. His unsuccessful attempt to leverage the congressional elections to display his own power set off a mess of infighting and recriminations over the failure of the GOP to stir a red wave to claim big congressional majorities. It also raised questions over Trump’s own 2024 general election viability. The result is that the GOP in Washington is further weakened and Trump is under some of the most intense pressure he’s faced during a turbulent political career – even if there’s no sign yet that his enduring power base in the party’s adoring grassroots has eroded.\n",

      "Should Donald Trump announce his third presidential bid on Tuesday, as is widely expected, he will begin the next phase of his political career under siege. Seven years ago, the New York businessman entered the political fray on defense, working vigorously to cast himself as a serious contender for the Republican presidential nomination to the incredulity of veteran political operatives and his primary opponents. This time, Trump takes the plunge as the party’s indisputable frontrunner, but once again, he finds himself in a defensive crouch. On the brink of a campaign launch that elicits both enthusiasm and dread from different corners of his own party, Trump’s quest to return to the Oval Office could face untold obstacles in the months to come, even with his loyal base firmly intact. He has spent the days since the midterm elections fending off criticism from fellow Republicans over his ill-fated involvement in key contests, furiously lashing out at two GOP heavyweights who could complicate his path to the White House if they mount their own presidential campaigns, and fretting that he or associates could soon be indicted by federal investigators in two separate Justice Department probes.\n",

Larry Hogan of Maryland said Sunday that former President Donald Trump has cost the GOP the last three elections and it’s past time to reassess what’s important to the party. “It’s basically the third election in a row that Donald Trump has cost us the race, and it’s like, three strikes, you’re out,” Hogan said during an appearance on “State of the Union” with CNN’s Dana Bash. “This should have been a huge red wave. It should have been one of the biggest red waves we’ve ever had,” added Hogan, who was ineligible to run for a third term in Maryland this year. Despite President Joe Biden’s low approval ratings, the governor said his party “still didn’t perform.”\n",

The party defied the historical trend of midterm elections breaking against parties in power and overcame anxiety over high inflation, cementing its majority as voters rejected Republican candidates who had aligned themselves with former President Donald Trump and in many cases parroted his lies about widespread election fraud. Retaining Senate control is a huge boost to President Joe Biden over the remaining two years of his first term in the White House, with one more Senate race outstanding that will determine the final balance of power in the chamber – and how much leverage the president’s party will ultimately have.\n",

Cortez Masto had long been viewed as one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents as she fended off a challenge from former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt in a state whose economy had been hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic and inflation. With Cortez Masto – the first Latina senator – securing a second term, Democrats will hold 50 seats and Republicans will hold 49. Democrats are also defending a seat in Georgia, where Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker are headed to a December 6 runoff. But even if Republicans pick up that seat, the chamber would still be evenly divided, allowing Vice President Kamala Harris to still hold the tie-breaking vote. Democrats were able to hold the majority, in part, because they picked up a seat in Pennsylvania, where Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, a Democrat, defeated Trump-backed Mehmet Oz in the contest to replace retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey.\n"

CNN projected late Friday that Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, who was elected in 2020 to fill the term of the late GOP Sen. John McCain, will win reelection, capping a string of victories for his party. Kelly’s defeat of venture capitalist Blake Masters, who had echoed former President Donald Trump’s lies about the 2020 election, marked yet another rejection by voters of a Trump-backed candidate who Democrats portrayed as an extremist. So far, Democrats will hold 49 seats in the Senate and Republicans will hold 49 – meaning Democrats only need one more seat to clinch the majority in the Senate (with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tie breaking vote). They could reach that critical 50-seat threshold if they are successful in Nevada, where Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is closing in on Republican Adam Laxalt, the state’s former attorney general – who called the 2020 presidential election “rigged” and filed lawsuits on Trump’s behalf trying to overturn Biden’s 2020 victory in the Silver State.\n",

Nevada has been a battleground state since the early 1990s, but Joe Biden narrowly clinched victory in the Silver State in 2020 despite significant effort by Donald Trump, particularly in Nevada’s rural areas.

The state’s workers then faced a double hit as inflation rose and gas prices topped $5 a gallon in a state where many people must drive long distances to work.\n",

McConney reiterated he followed instructions from former Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg and other high-level Trump Org. executives to tack on fringe benefits to their salaries in bonuses that were ultimately not reported to tax authorities. McConney also cut bonus checks via 1099 tax forms meant for independent contractors – a method that does not withhold taxes on the employer’s end. Those employees then did not report those bonuses as income on their personal taxes, so they took the money tax-free over several years, he confirmed.\n",

Ron DeSantis rarely engaged in the speculation or mudslinging. He insisted a statement victory in his bid for a second term needed to precede any discussion of 2024. On Tuesday night, that statement came in the form of a 19-point landslide win over Democrat Charlie Crist – the most lopsided victory by a Republican gubernatorial nominee in Florida history and a gap that dwarfed Trump’s own Sunshine State win in 2020. Within minutes of the polls closing, DeSantis’ Tampa election night party burst into euphoria as the totality and breadth of his resounding performance began to crystalize. DeSantis had turned once-solidly blue counties red, won over a majority of Latino voters and carried on his coattails Republican candidates up and down the ballot and in every corner of the state. “We not only won election, we have rewritten the political map,” DeSantis declared to his supporters before confetti rained down on him and his family. Some in the crowd urged him to consider a White House bid by chanting, “Two more years!”\n",

      "Donald Trump wanted to catapult himself into a third presidential campaign with a wave of Republican midterm gains behind him. Instead, he emerges from Tuesday’s underwhelming election night facing questions about his political future and with the momentum behind Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, potentially his potential chief nemesis in a 2024 primary. With key races still too early to call in Arizona and Nevada, and with Georgia heading to a Senate runoff, Trump entered Wednesday with few victories to tout and the possibility that they might soon be overshadowed by further losses. His chosen candidates for open Senate seats in Ohio and North Carolina prevailed, as did incumbent Republican Sen. Ron Johnson in Wisconsin. But he lost a critical Senate contest in Pennsylvania, where Mehmet Oz, whom he backed in the primary despite widespread concerns about his electability, was defeated by Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman. In Michigan, Trump’s candidate in the governor’s race failed to unseat Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. And while Republicans still appear to be on track to capture a House majority, it is likely to be far slimmer than initially thought.\n",

But although Florida Gov.

Even with many races still to be called, exit polls and results in some key House races showed the party improving on the margins, but not making the leap among Latino voters GOP strategists had sought.

Hochul’s victory keeps New York Democrats on track to maintain their now nearly two-decade-old winning streak in statewide elections. A Buffalo native, Hochul took over the top job in August 2021 following the resignation of Andrew Cuomo, the three-term governor who faced impeachment amid a sexual harassment scandal. Despite being his lieutenant governor, Hochul and Cuomo were never closely aligned and she moved quickly upon taking office to clear it of his allies. Already the first woman to hold the governor’s office in New York, Hochul will now become the first to win it in an election. Zeldin, a conservative acolyte of former President Donald Trump, ran a “law and order” campaign almost entirely focused on fears over rising crime and a 2019 criminal justice reform law that made it more difficult for judges to hold suspects in pre-trial detention. But he also tapped into frustration over the state of the economy, which has been slow to recover in and around New York City following the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic, and working-class concerns over environmental initiatives such as a plan to hike fees for automobiles entering heavily trafficked parts of the city.\n",

      "Pennsylvania Democratic Senate nominee John Fetterman’s campaign has gone to a federal court to try to have Pennsylvania voters’ mail-in ballots counted if they weren’t signed with a valid date. The question of whether mailed ballots with incorrect or missing dates can be counted is one of the hottest voting disputes in the pivotal state leading up to Election Day, and a divided Pennsylvania Supreme Court recently ordered counties to refrain from counting mailed ballots with missing or invalid dates on their outer envelopes. But Fetterman and voters his campaign has aligned with are hoping the federal court will supersede the state court’s decision.\n",

      "House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy is vowing to secure the border, cut back on government spending and launch rigorous investigations into the Biden administration if Republicans win the House on Tuesday, reflecting a mix of priorities as McCarthy will be forced to contend with an increasingly hardline and pro-Trump conference that is itching to impeach President Joe Biden. In an exclusive, wide-ranging interview with CNN, two days before the midterm elections, McCarthy outlined his plans for power, which includes tackling inflation, rising crime and border security – three issues that have become central to Republicans’ closing pitch to voters. To hammer home that message, McCarthy – who has been barnstorming the country in the run-up to the midterms – rallied here on Sunday for a trio of Hispanic GOP women who are vying to represent key districts along the southern border, a key part of the party’s strategy for winning the majority. “The first thing you’ll see is a bill to control the border first,” McCarthy told CNN, when asked for specifics about his party’s immigration plans. “You’ve got to get control over the border. You’ve had almost 2 million people just this year alone coming across.”\n",

      "Republicans are increasingly bullish on winning big in Tuesday’s midterm elections, as they slam Democrats over raging inflation and crime while President Joe Biden seeks a late reprieve by warning that GOP election deniers could destroy democracy. The GOP has considerable momentum in its bid to win back the House of Representatives while the destiny of the Democratic-run Senate will come down to a handful of knife-edge races. A Republican triumph in either chamber would severely curtail Biden’s domestic presidency and set up an acrimonious two years of political standoffs ahead of the 2024 White House race. In an exclusive interview with CNN, the potential next Republican House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, laid out his plans for power and vowed to tackle inflation, border security and rising crime. He promised broad investigations against the Biden administration on the Afghanistan withdrawal, the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic and how the administration has dealt with parents and school board meetings. And he didn’t rule out an eventual push to impeach Biden.\n",

Hopes that Democrats could use the Supreme Court’s overturning of the right to an abortion and a flurry of legislative wins to stave off the classic midterm election rout of a party in power are now a memory. Biden faces a dark political environment because of the 40-year-high in the cost of living – and his hopes of a swift rebound next year are clouded by growing fears of a recession. On the eve of the election, Democrats risk losing control of the House of Representatives and Republicans are increasingly hopeful of a Senate majority that would leave Biden under siege as he begins his reelection bid and with ex-President Donald Trump apparently set to announce his own campaign for a White House return within days.\n",

The former president will welcome supporters in Miami, the third stop in a four-city tour that has effectively made Trump a leading player in his party’s fight for control of Congress. Meanwhile, the Florida governor is headlining his own events in three counties on the state’s opposite coast – Hillsborough, Sarasota and Lee – steering far clear of Trump as he seeks to close out his bid for a second term. For the past two years, Trump and DeSantis have coexisted on opposite ends of Florida – Trump plotting his next move from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach and DeSantis building himself into a household name from the state capital in Tallahassee. But as these midterms come to a close and with a decision looming about their political futures, even on a peninsula 450 miles long, it has become increasingly difficult for the two to avoid each other.\n"

      "A lawyer for former President Donald Trump described Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas as “key” to Trump’s plan to delay Congress’ certification of President Joe Biden’s victory through litigation after the 2020 election, according to emails recently turned over to the House select committee investigating January 6. “We want to frame things so that Thomas could be the one to issue” a temporary order putting Georgia’s results in doubt, Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro wrote in a December 31, 2020, email, adding that a favorable order from Thomas was their “only chance” to hold up Congress from counting electoral votes for Biden from Georgia. John Eastman, another attorney for Trump, responded to that email saying he agreed with the plan. In the email exchanges with several other lawyers working on Trump’s legal team, they were discussing filing a lawsuit that they hoped would result in an order that “TENTATIVELY” held that Biden electoral votes from Georgia were not valid because of election fraud.\n",

      "Joe Biden’s eloquent defense of democracy was a message Americans needed to hear. But it was not the one voters most want now from their president – that relief is at hand from the soaring cost of living. Biden’s speech Wednesday, delivered blocks from the US Capitol that was ransacked by ex-President Donald Trump’s mob on January 6, 2021, was a strong election-closing argument. But for an election other than the one taking place next week. That’s not to say that the warning was misplaced. The fact that Biden felt the need to say, “We can’t take democracy for granted any longer,” underscores the grave threat posed to America’s core values by political violence and election denialism. If a president does not safeguard this historic legacy, who will? The chaos and violence Trump incited after the 2020 election show what unfolds when a president chooses to try to destroy democracy for personal gain.\n",

      "Ohio Democratic Senate candidate Rep. Tim Ryan on Thursday said he doesn’t want help from his own national party, telling “CNN This Morning” that he doesn’t “really want them at this point.” “You know, the national Democratic Party has never been really good at strategic political decisions. So you know, it is not a surprise here, and thank God that I have enough experience that I’ve built this campaign not needing them and we really don’t want them at this point. We’re gonna do this thing with all the grassroots people we have here,” said Ryan, who is pitted against J.D. Vance, a Donald Trump ally, in a tight race. The comments from Ryan underscore his efforts to cast himself as a more moderate candidate and distance himself from the national Democratic Party, including President Joe Biden, whose approval ratings are sagging. With the midterms just around the corner, Biden and former President Barack Obama have descended upon states that have critical elections, but neither has turned up in Ohio.\n",

Darren Bailey last Friday and left a lengthy voicemail, according to the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office. “I’m going to skin Darren Bailey alive, making sure he is still alive … and screaming in f***ing pain,” Lennox allegedly said, according to a bond proffer from the prosecutor’s office. He is also accused of saying, “I know where he lives, I know where he sleeps, I know where his kids sleep.” The voicemail message concluded with, “Yeah, that’s right so he better kill himself and if he doesn’t, I am going to kill him,” according to the document filed in Cook County Circuit Court. The call was traced to Lennox using caller ID and the Illinois Secretary of State Police initially interviewed him. The court document said Lennox admitted to the call. “The Illinois Secretary of State Police deemed (Lennox) was not a credible threat and did not arrest (Lennox) or transport him to any location for further questioning.” However, the case was referred to Illinois State Police, who did arrest Lennox after interviewing him and examining his phone.\n",

Clinton, despite being one of the best-known Democrats in the country, has been one of the party’s least visible surrogates at campaign rallies in recent years. Her event with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul will be the first candidate-specific rally she will headline this year. That New York Democrats are asking for her help to juice turnout in Manhattan underscores the deep anxiety coursing through the party as Election Day nears, with Hochul locked in a tight race against Republican Lee Zeldin. Clinton will join Hochul, Vice President Kamala Harris and New York Attorney General Letitia James for an event at Barnard College that, organizers say, will bring together the top female political figures in the state and nationally to energize women voters to turn out and elect Hochul to her first full term. Hochul, New York’s first female governor, was elevated to the top position in August 2021 following former Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s resignation amid sexual harassment scandals.\n",

For the second time in less than two years, the Peach State, which elected two Democratic senators in the last election cycle, is home to a contest that has gripped both national parties and potentially holds the key to the fate of President Joe Biden’s agenda. This time around, though, at least one key characteristic of the race has been reversed: Democrat Raphael Warnock has gone from challenger to incumbent, trying to fend off Republican nominee Herschel Walker. The former football great, recruited and endorsed by former President Donald Trump, has run an uneven campaign and spent the past month beset by controversy, but is still running neck-and-neck with Warnock with early voting in high gear and Election Day nearing.\n"

Pelosi placed a 911 call during last Friday’s attack after convincing the assailant to let him go to the bathroom, where his phone was charging, and he spoke cryptically to police.

Liz Cheney returned to the campaign trail Tuesday night, receiving a standing ovation more than 1,600 miles from her Wyoming home – and a world away from the Republican politics that have been her family’s lifeblood. She will be leaving office in two months, following a resounding defeat in her August primary to a Trump-backed challenger. But Cheney made clear that she is intent on trying to shape the next session of Congress and stop – or limit – the scope of a potential Republican majority not committed to protecting democracy. “If we want to ensure the survival of the republic, we have to walk away from politics as usual,” Cheney said. “We have to stand up – every one of us – and say we’re going to do what’s right for this country and we’re going to look beyond partisan politics.”\n",

Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the vice chairwoman of the panel, said Tuesday. Cheney’s comments came days after CNN reported that Trump’s team formally agreed to accept service of a subpoena issued to him by the House panel seeking documents and testimony from the former president. Publicly, the response by Trump’s team has been limited to a rambling letter sent to committee members that attacked their work and declining to say whether Trump would agree to a sworn deposition. Stil, Trump faces a Friday deadline to respond to the committee’s subpoena for documents, and a November 14 deadline for testimony. Cheney said during an event about the threat of political violence in Cleveland, Ohio, that the former President “has an obligation to comply,” but the panel has not yet made determinations about the format of his potential testimony.\n",

Secretaries of state will play a critical role in managing and certifying the presidential election in 2024. The distinct possibility that some of these secretaries will be people with a history of election denial is a major challenge for American democracy – especially because former President Donald Trump, who is widely expected to run again in 2024, continues to pressure state officials to discard the will of voters.

Fetterman’s delivery during the contest was at times halting and repetitive, with the candidate dropping words during answers and occasionally losing his train of thought. The interview with CNN, like during the debate, was conducted with closed captioning technology. “I just always understood that it wasn’t going to be easy. I am five months into recovery from that, but I thought it was important that I show up and I did it. And at the end of the day, we did, I think, make some important points,” Fetterman said, noting that the debate also gave the Democratic campaign the opportunity to highlight Oz saying “local political leaders” should be involved with women and their doctors when making decisions about abortion.\n",

      "Six years of Donald Trump’s federal tax returns released on Friday show the former president paid very little in federal income taxes the first and last year of his presidency, claiming huge losses that helped limit his tax bill, among other revelations. The returns, long shrouded in secrecy, were released to the public on Friday by the House Ways and Means Committee, the culmination of a battle over their disclosure that went to the Supreme Court. They confirm a report issued from the Joint Committee on Taxation that Trump claimed large losses before and throughout his presidency that he carried forward to reduce or practically eliminate his tax burden. For example, his returns show that he carried forward a $105 million loss in 2015 and $73 million in 2016. The thousands of pages of documents from the former president’s personal and business federal tax returns – which spanned the years 2015 through 2020 – provide a complex web of raw data about Trump’s finances, offering up many questions about his wealth and income that could be pursued both by auditors and Trump’s political opponents.\n"

The White House has been working over the past several months to assemble a team of lawyers and other advisers to handle an expected onslaught of oversight requests. Thursday’s letter is the first indication of the team’s approach – one that vows cooperation but nonetheless pushes back on what the White House views as oversteps.\n",

      "The Biden administration has approved a potential $180 million arms sale to Taiwan amid ongoing tensions between the island and Beijing, the State Department announced Wednesday. The administration informed Congress Wednesday of its approval of the possible sale of vehicle-launched anti-tank munition-laying systems, and related equipment, to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office – Taiwan’s diplomatic outpost in the United States – the State Department said. “This proposed sale serves U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient’s continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability,” the statement said. “The proposed sale will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region.”\n",

      "President Joe Biden spent hours during his first foreign trip behind closed doors, attempting to reassure a shaken group of US allies that America was back. It was clear, he later told advisers, just how much work remained to convince them of the durability of that commitment. Eighteen months after those meetings in Europe, Biden departed Washington on Tuesday for his year-end vacation, riding the momentum of historic legislative success and the defiance of political gravity that has reshaped the expectations for the critical months – and decisions – ahead. It’s a moment that Biden never seemed to doubt would come, even as his party – and some inside the White House – questioned or outright urged a change in approach to address political and economic headwinds driven primarily by soaring inflation that threatened to drag down his presidency. During those 2021 meetings in England and Belgium, Biden found a group of allies genuinely shaken by the January 6 insurrection and the events that led to it. But the president tried to reassure them that the visceral divides that culminated in the violence that day would heal and the bleak moment in US politics would pass.\n",

      "A Maricopa County judge on Tuesday ordered Arizona Republican Kari Lake to compensate Democratic Gov.-elect Katie Hobbs for some legal fees related to the election lawsuit Lake had brought challenging her loss, but he stopped short of sanctioning Lake for filing the lawsuit. Judge Peter Thompson had rejected Lake’s lawsuit on Saturday, concluding that there wasn’t clear or convincing evidence of misconduct and affirming Hobbs’ victory. It was a major defeat for Lake, who had lost to Hobbs by about 17,000 votes and sued in an effort to overturn the election. She appealed that Christmas Eve ruling and will seek a direct review from the Arizona Supreme Court, according to a Tuesday afternoon filing. Attorneys for Hobbs – the current secretary of state – had charged that Lake and her lawyers knew their challenges to the election could not be substantiated, which would violate legal ethic rules. They wanted sanctions against Lake and her team. Thompson did not agree. “The Court finds that Plaintiff’s claims presented in this litigation were not groundless and brought in bad faith,” he wrote on Tuesday.\n",

She said Zelensky’s historic address “strengthened both Democrats and Republicans who understand what is at stake in this fight against Putin and Russian aggression and now with their ally, Iran, as well.”\n",

      "House Republicans on Wednesday released a report focused on security failures at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, highlighting well-documented breakdowns in intelligence sharing, Capitol security and coordination between various law enforcement agencies that responded that day. Their primary recommendation centers around reforming the US Capitol Police Board and bolstering congressional oversight of the Capitol Police force – two issues that were identified by lawmakers of both parties in the wake of the January 6 attack. But the GOP report is silent on other efforts to disrupt the transfer of presidential power after the 2020 election and selective in its criticism of political leaders and their culpability in the security breakdowns on January 6. The report resurfaces largely unfounded allegations to cast blame on Democrats like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi while glossing over former President Donald Trump’s own role.\n",

The Atlanta-area special grand jury has largely finished hearing witness testimony and has already begun writing its final report, the sources said, an indication that prosecutors will soon be deciding whether to seek criminal charges and against whom. In Georgia, special grand juries are not authorized to issue indictments. The final report serves as a mechanism for the panel to recommend whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis should pursue indictments in her election interference investigation. Willis could then go to a regularly empaneled grand jury to seek indictments.\n",

      "The cruel truth of American democracy, usually experienced by Democrats, is that a political party can get more votes than the other without winning much power. This year, however, it’s Republicans who got more votes – more than 3 million more votes for GOP House candidates – and don’t have as much to show for it. Republicans actually lost ground in the Senate, where Democrats will have a slim 51-49 majority. The GOP House majority, while an important check on the White House, is small and spread across a broad enough ideological spectrum that it will be difficult for potential House speaker Kevin McCarthy, or whoever is ultimately able to win that position, to use the majority to act decisively.\n",

The committee’s final recommendations could include additional charges proposed for Trump, according to the source. The referral recommendations will be presented at a committee meeting on Monday and the final report will provide justification from the panel’s investigation for recommending the charges. The impact House referrals could have remains unclear because the Department of Justice special counsel investigation is already examining Trump in its extensive probe into January 6. But in addition to criminal referrals, committee Chairman Bennie Thompson told reporters that the panel could issue five to six other categories of referrals, such as ethics referrals to the House Ethics Committee, bar discipline referrals and campaign finance referrals.\n",

But we’re also going to be the only ones that can move forward. But it would delay everything, getting committees up and running, being able to do the things that you know we need to get done from the very beginning.” McCarthy’s comments represent a sharp escalation in his public pressure campaign against the five members who have signaled they plan to deny him the 218 votes he needs to become speaker when the new Congress convenes in January. McCarthy has spent hours behind closed doors negotiating a series of rules that the hardline faction wants in order to weaken the speakership and empower their members.\n"

While discussions over retributions for McCarthy’s foes, which have not been previously reported, have not gone beyond casual conversations among rank-and-file members, the threat shows how Republicans – particularly moderates – are wrestling with ways to act as a counterweight to the so-called “Never Kevin” movement, which is threatening to derail the California Republican’s speakership bid. In addition to booting the McCarthy holdouts off committee assignments, various members are considering several other ways to potentially de-fang the threat from their right-wing colleagues. That includes weighing whether to oppose a rules package if it includes reinstating an arcane tool that would empower any member to bring up a floor vote to oust a speaker at any time, as well as the longshot idea of teaming up across the aisle with Democrats to elect a speaker if the race goes to multiple ballots and no one budges.\n"

DeSantis also said Tuesday he was launching a public health integrity committee – a panel that would counter the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which DeSantis said “is not serving a useful function; it’s really serving to advance narratives rather than do evidence-based medicine.” The panel would assess guidance and actions from federal agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health, US Food and Drug Administration and the CDC.\n",

Republican leader Kevin McCarthy is far from assured of winning sufficient support in his party to become House speaker next month. But even before the vote, his authority is already weakening by the day – in a way that could make him a speaker who is in office but not in power. The tiny GOP House majority that takes over in January, after a disappointing midterm performance, would mean a fragile governing mandate for any party at any point in American history. And the ideological struggle being waged by pro-Donald Trump extremists inside the party would have made even a more comfortable majority volatile.\n",

      "The Biden administration plans to conduct a trial for portions of the naturalization exam, which immigrants must pass to become US citizens, next year, to try to make the test more accessible, US Citizenship and Immigration Services will announce Wednesday. The naturalization exam is a crucial step to an immigrant’s path toward US citizenship, potentially impacting hundreds of thousands of immigrants who seek citizenship annually. President Joe Biden signed an executive order at the start of his administration that included a directive to review the English and civics tests for naturalization. Wednesday’s announcement is a result of that order. The trial will include changes to the English-speaking component of the test, which is not standardized, and the civics component following a review by USCIS subject matter experts, according to the agency. The two other parts of the exam – reading and writing – are already standardized and will remain unchanged.\n",

Perry believed election security was compromised, contributing to Donald Trump’s loss of the presidency, and wanted to preserve voting machines after the election.

      "The House Republican Conference is still entrenched in an internal war over whether to reinstate an arcane rule that would empower any member to bring up a vote to oust a speaker at any time. The bitter divide is only heating up and has emerged center stage in House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy’s quest for 218 votes to win the position. For McCarthy’s backers, the so-called motion to vacate is seen as little more than a promise of hostage taking, a tool that could be used by the right flank to hamstring McCarthy’s ability to lead the conference and effectively govern. “There’s a reason [the motion to vacate] already got debated. You can’t govern with a gun to your head and that is what they are asking for. It makes us highly unstable, and it lays out the potential too for Democrats to take advantage of this and create absolute chaos,” Rep. Dan Crenshaw, a Texas Republican, told CNN. “There is a reason people are against it. You can scream the word accountability all you want … in the end it’s just a path to chaos, not stability, and we are going to have to be very united and very stable if we are going to govern properly. “\n",

      "Donald Trump is heading for a period of maximum legal and political risk over his role in the US Capitol insurrection and hoarding of classified documents that will collide with his efforts to electrify a low wattage 2024 White House bid. A quickening special counsel probe, now focusing on the alleged attempt to steal Georgia’s election, the climax of the House January 6 committee and a new trial of pro-Trump Oath Keepers extremists underscore the breadth of attempts to secure accountability over one of the darkest days in modern American history. These new signs of a net possibly closing around Trump and his allies come a month after voters sent a signal of disapproval with his obsession over the 2020 election by repudiating many midterm candidates in swing states who bought his claims of voter fraud. But each sign that once slow burning efforts to work through the trauma of the post-election period are heating up brings a parallel warning that the future threat to truth and democracy remains acute. Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, for instance – a key force in the incoming GOP House majority that is likely to try to shut down or obstruct investigations into Trump – is embroiled in yet another controversy over the insurrection.\n",

But President Joe Biden’s decision to exchange WNBA star Brittney Griner for Viktor Bout goes beyond the exchange’s bottom line. It represented a humane resolution to a painful dilemma that came after tortuous talks with a Russian regime that treats people as geopolitical pawns every day.

But the tragic counterpoint to this diplomatic triumph – Biden’s failure to also secure the release of Paul Whelan, another American incarcerated in a Russian penal colony – underscored the unforgiving moral conundrum he faced.

Hours after Trump’s hand-picked candidate, Herschel Walker, failed to pick up a Democratic seat, the blame game began in earnest – in large part directed at the former president. Many argued that the party establishment must take a heavier hand in the 2024 election cycle and root out unelectable Republicans even if they’re backed by Trump. Others said the GOP needs to embrace early voting and wholly reject Trump’s demagoguery of mail-in voting, something that helped power Democratic victories.\n",

Khan resigned last month after he was accused of “inappropriate touching and unwanted kissing by at least one woman,” according to The New York Times.\n",

The firm represents a number of Trump associates who have appeared before a grand jury in Washington, DC, or spoken with investigators as part of the Justice Department’s investigation into the handling of government documents seized from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate after he left the White House.\n",

A former White House speechwriter and senior adviser to Trump, Miller could provide a firsthand account of the former president’s preparations for his speech at the Ellipse in Washington on January 6, including how he wanted to inspire his supporters, many of whom went on to attack the Capitol and disrupt Congress’ certification of the election.\n"

It’s an issue confronting House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, who is rounding up the votes to win the House speaker race and facing pressure from some of his colleagues to more forcefully detail how he plans to handle the sensitive topic before they decide whether to support him on January 3 for the most powerful position in Congress. In interviews with CNN, more than two dozen House GOP lawmakers laid out their demands to avoid the nation’s first-ever debt default, ranging from new immigration policies to imposing deep domestic spending cuts. And several Republicans flatly said they would oppose raising the borrowing limit even if all their demands were met, making McCarthy’s narrow path even narrower.\n",

Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock was the leading vote-getter in the November general election, over Republican nominee Herschel Walker, but he fell short of the majority need to win the race outright.

      "The highly touted red wave in last month’s midterm election failed to develop largely because it hit a wall of resistance among independent voters, especially across the key battleground states. And that presents difficult questions for Republicans looking forward to 2024. The GOP’s disappointing showing among independents this year marked the third consecutive election in which the party has underperformed with those critical swing voters. Although Donald Trump ran competitively among independents in his first presidential race in 2016, since he took office, the GOP has consistently faced broad opposition among them, especially those who are women or hold four-year college degrees. The GOP’s 2022 struggles with independents were especially striking because they came even as most of those voters expressed negative views of both President Joe Biden’s job performance and the state of the economy – sentiments that typically cause most swing voters to break for the party out of the White House. To many analysts in both parties, the reluctance of so many independents to support Republican candidates despite such discontent underscores how powerfully the Trump-era GOP has alienated these voters.\n",

      "DEMOCRATIC REACTION TO SCALISE SHOOTING IS MODEL FOR GOP TODAY. Many Democrats and their allies in the media are blaming Republicans for a deranged man's attack on Paul Pelosi, husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). There's no question suspect David DePape is deranged, or what the British would call barking mad. Consider this, from the Washington Post: \"In [a] blog post on October 24, four days before the attack on Pelosi, DePape shared images of a wooden birdhouse he said he had purchased for an invisible fairy he communicated with that had begun interfering with his life. 'He appears in a form that makes sense in my reality because I can't see fairies. He'll do things to let me know it's him and he often appears as a bird,' DePape wrote.\"Or consider this headline, from the San Francisco Chronicle: \"Ex-girlfriend of suspect in Paul Pelosi attack says he struggled with mental illness, believed he was 'Jesus for a year.'\" The obvious conclusion: DePape is mentally ill. He has been mentally ill for a long time. He has the kind of mental illness that lawyers often use as a defense if a person is accused of a crime.In recent days, apparently, DePape fixated on Nancy Pelosi. \"DePape stated that he was going to hold Nancy hostage and talk to her,\" reads an FBI affidavit accompanying federal charges against DePape. \"If Nancy were to tell DePape the 'truth,' he would let her go, and if she 'lied,' he was going to break 'her kneecaps.' DePape was certain that Nancy would not have told the 'truth.' In the course of the interview, DePape articulated he viewed Nancy as the 'leader of the pack' of lies told by the Democratic Party.\"\n",

Circuit rejected his bid to reconsider its previous ruling that paved the way for his tax information to be sent to the House Ways and Means Committee.Roberts, who handles emergency appeals stemming from the District of Columbia, asked for a response from the committee by Nov. 10 — two days after the midterm elections. The appeals court ruling was due to take effect on Thursday.\n",

      "Lt. Gov. John Fetterman (D-PA) defended his much-discussed debate performance against Dr. Mehmet Oz in an interview. Fetterman, who is locked in a tight battle for the crucial Senate seat, told CNN's Don Lemon he knew the debate \"wasn't going to be easy\" but still felt like it served a purpose. “I just always understood that it wasn’t going to be easy. I am five months into recovery from that, but I thought it was important that I show up and I did it. And at the end of the day, we did, I think, make some important points,” Fetterman told CNN.\n",

      "Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) disclosed a sell-off worth thousands of dollars in Meta stock before shares of the tech giant plummeted in value, filings show. McCaul, one of the most active stock trade filers in Congress, disclosed on Oct. 14 that in September, accounts owned by his wife and child sold between $61,000 and $215,000 combined of Meta, the multinational tech conglomerate that owns Facebook. But only two weeks later, on Thursday, Meta shares took a nosedive by over $700 billion, or 24%, after the company reported earnings that skirted investor expectations. \"Congressman McCaul did not purchase these stocks,\" Elliot Berke, a lawyer for McCaul, told the Washington Examiner. \"Rather, his wife has assets she solely owns, and a third-party manager made the purchase without her direction.\"\n",

Lee Zeldin, the Republican candidate for governor of the Empire State, has sounded increasingly bullish in recent days of his midterm chances as polls show him gaining ground on Hochul.On Monday, he told Fox News: \"We have the energy, we have the momentum on our side. We have the issues on our side. We feel very good. As long as we keep working hard, we are going to absolutely shock the political world, not just here in New York, but around the country.\"\n"

Haberman has covered Trump for at least 11 years, accumulating in a new book she's releasing soon on the former president called Confidence Man: The Making of Donald Trump and the Breaking of America. CBS News anchor John Dickerson asked Haberman in an interview that aired Sunday for her view on whether Trump will run again. Haberman warned that she did not know the answer for certain and that she believes the former president has put himself in a position where he has no choice but to run. “I think he’s backed himself into a corner where he has to run,” Haberman said. “I think that he needs the protections that running for president [he thinks] would afford him in combating investigations that he calls a ‘witch hunt.'”\n",

The agency's admission came in a letter dated Friday, but released Saturday, from NARA Archivist Debra Steidel Wall to the House Oversight and Reform Committee's chairwoman, Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY). Maloney had written to the National Archives in September to ask about presidential records that remain unaccounted for after the August raid of Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate, which produced scores of documents but raised the question of if other materials were still missing. “While there is no easy way to establish absolute accountability, we do know that we do not have custody of everything we should,” Steidel Wall said, going on to reference official Trump administration business that was conducted \"using non-official electronic messaging accounts that were not copied or forwarded into their official electronic messaging accounts.\"\n",

The former president also took aim at McConnell’s wife Elaine Chao, who was Trump's transportation secretary before she resigned in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 riot, calling her “his China loving wife, Coco Chow!” Chao was born in Taipei, Taiwan. “This isn’t some crazy person on the internet, this is the GOP front-runner for President if the Party doesn’t wake up & demand better,” Griffin said in a tweet. “He’s not even trying to hide the racism at this point.

It’s not entirely clear what legislation Trump is referring to, but his comments came after the Senate passed a stopgap funding bill. The legislation would keep the government funded until Dec. 16, and it was supported by McConnell and other Republicans. It also follows the Senate minority leader confirming he would back the Electoral Reform Act, a bipartisan bill aiming to make it harder to object to presidential election results following the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. “Is McConnell approving all of these Trillions of Dollars worth of Democrat sponsored Bills, without even the slightest bit of negotiation, because he hates Donald J. Trump, and he knows I am strongly opposed to them, or is he doing it because he believes in the Fake and Highly Destructive Green New Deal, and is willing to take the Country down with him?” Trump said in a Truth Social post. “In any event, either reason is unacceptable. He has a DEATH WISH.”\n",

      "ERIE, Pennsylvania — Republicans are out to tie the green climate policies backed by President Joe Biden and other liberals in Congress around John Fetterman's neck, hoping it'll help sink the Pennsylvania lieutenant governor in a race that could decide the balance of the Senate. Fetterman has distanced himself from some of the most hawkish positions on climate change promoted by, for instance, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who ran on a national fracking ban in 2020. But celebrity physician Dr. Mehmet Oz and his backers in the National Republican Senatorial Committee are playing up the overlap between the former Braddock mayor and the broader climate policy positions of the party and of Biden, who nixed the Keystone XL pipeline and campaigned on restricting oil and gas leasing on federal lands. The backdrop of Fetterman's faceoff against Oz is a fierce ideological battle in Washington over the future of U.S. energy policy. That battle has grown more intense during this Congress thanks to partisan strife, sustained high energy prices domestically, and a global energy crisis that many officials have assessed as direr than the oil crisis of the 1970s.\n",

Claire McCaskill was roasted by Tucker Carlson and others for her comments Wednesday about Hurricane Ian as it barreled through Florida. \"Now the one thing I do hope, Joe, to put a little politics in this,\" she said on MSNBC's Morning Joe. \"We all are praying for the people of Florida. We hope the devastation is not deadly. We are glad for the cooperation, but when it’s all over, I hope some of those Floridians who hate the federal government remember that the federal government is there for them at a time of disaster.” As Carlson put it, yeah, this is a pretty gross thing to be saying while my own relatives are potentially in danger of dying. But now that there's a bit of distance between then and now, I also want to point out that it's a pretty stupid thing to say. Where did she get this idea that people in Florida hate the federal government?\n",

      "Former President Donald Trump took repeated aim at Democratic political foes and heaped praise on loyal Republicans as he stumped for GOP candidates in Michigan on Saturday evening. The 45th president held one of his signature \"Save America\" rallies in Warren, Michigan, located just north of Detroit, to campaign for the state's GOP gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon as she tries to oust incumbent Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, whom she trails in the polls. While in office, Whitmer was a frequent thorn in Trump's side. Their widely reported feud escalated during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the Democrat became a vocal critic of Trump's handling of the crisis. The former president slammed Whitmer on multiple fronts, going after her position on abortion, her handling of rising crime, and her own COVID-19 response. “Michigan, you need to dump this wild-eyed extremist Gretchen Whitmer and put Tudor Dixon in the governor’s mansion,” Trump told the crowd at the Macomb County Community College Sports & Expo Center. \"The first step to restoring public safety is defeating the radical Democrats this November, and that starts with trouncing Whitmer.\"\n",

Once a proud supporter of Black Lives Matter, Fetterman scrubbed every mention of the police-defunding movement from his website, just as Republican Senate candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz was hammering Fetterman on crime. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, however, doesn’t face the voters until next year. Despite the fact that over 1,000 people have been killed in Philadelphia over the past 20 months, Krasner insists that his decision not to prosecute most nonviolent crimes, including theft, is “working.” Exactly for whom is it working? When you see Krasner's record, you realize he might be in earnest. His policy is \"working\" for the career criminals whom he views as victims of the justice system.\n"

The poll ran from Sept. 21-25. The survey also found economic concerns trumping abortion, with 82% saying inflation was their top priority and 68% saying jobs and unemployment were most important, compared to 56% who said the same about abortion.Concern about the loss of federal protections for abortion rights in the wake of the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization ruling was a big driver in the Democrats’ improvement in the polls in late August and early September. Data from the latest Monmouth Poll suggest that rise has subsided, reverting to a political atmosphere that would be expected to produce substantial Republican gains.\n",

      "Lawyers for former President Donald Trump called upon the Supreme Court to reverse an appeals court ruling that reversed a lower court ruling allowing for a special master to review allegedly classified documents seized at Mar-a-Lago. Last month, an appeals court panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit granted the Justice Department’s request for a partial stay of a lower court order, allowing the DOJ to continue its criminal investigation using roughly 100 allegedly classified documents the FBI seized from Trump's Florida resort home. Trump wants the Supreme Court to intervene. “The Eleventh Circuit lacked jurisdiction to review, much less stay, an interlocutory order of the District Court providing for the Special Master to review materials seized from President Trump’s home, including approximately 103 documents the Government contends bear classification markings,” Trump’s lawyers told the Supreme Court on Tuesday. “This application seeks to vacate only that portion of the Eleventh Circuit’s Stay Order limiting the scope of the Special Master’s review of the documents bearing classification markings.”\n",

The accusations, broken by the Daily Beast on Monday evening, are the latest in a string of controversies for Walker, ranging from multiple undisclosed children to allegations he inflated the success of his business record. Walker, who has run on a \"no exceptions\" anti-abortion platform, has vehemently denied the accusations. Responding to a $700 check the outlet said he sent the woman for the procedure, as well as a \"get well\" card apparently signed by Walker, the Republican Senate candidate said he sends “money to a lot of people.” He has threatened to sue the publication over its reporting.\n",

      "North Korea launched a ballistic missile over Japan and into the Pacific Ocean, once again giving rise to global fears. Traveling 2,800 miles, this missile test proves Kim Jong Un's restored willingness to escalate against the United States and South Korea. Kim is evidently frustrated by the Biden administration's decision to ignore North Korea and instead focus on the Russian war against Ukraine. Gutting the central objective of U.S. diplomacy toward his regime, Kim has already committed North Korea to retaining its nuclear weapons. Nevertheless, he hopes his variable ability to dangle or defer missile tests and nuclear escalation will earn him financial concessions. Kim is likely gambling that rising tensions over Russian President Vladimir Putin's nuclear threats will make Washington desperate to avoid a new crisis and thus more amenable to placating him. The U.S. should, of course, reject any such hypothesis. While the U.S. obsession with North Korea's full denuclearization is borderline delusional (why would Kim give up that which affords him regime security?), Washington cannot reward North Korean blackmail. That choice wouldn't simply undermine the U.S. security umbrella in the western Pacific — it would signal U.S. weakness to other adversaries further afield. The correct response to this test is to bolster joint South Korean-U.S. military drills and engage Japan more fully in regional military activities. The U.S. could also redeploy the Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier strike group (which left South Korea last week) to the North Korea-proximate Sea of Japan. At the same time, the U.S. should also encourage European partners to seize North Korean foreign capital assets held in their banks.\n",

Glenn Youngkin wants his state to repeal a legislative mandate conforming Virginia 's vehicle standards to California 's on the basis that it could make a \"disastrous combination\" in conjunction with an evolving grid.

The plan also takes aim at a separate Virginia law passed in 2021 that directs state regulators to adopt air quality standards of the California Air Resources Board, which just in August finalized a zero-emission vehicle standard that bans the sale of nonelectric vehicles by 2035. Youngkin's plan said that such a standard could clash with a phase-down of baseload power generation, or generation from thermal sources such as natural gas or nuclear power, that can be adjusted in concert with demand.\n",

      "Democrats love to cite opinion polls when trying to justify their political will. It's a tactic they regularly use on various political issues to persuade people that their way of thinking is the correct way. It's almost as if they believe opinion polls should dictate policy decisions. Keeping with those standards and logic, and based on recent surveys, the Left should support busing illegal immigrants to \"sanctuary\" cities controlled by Democrats. Yet, there appeared to be an overall lack of enthusiasm on their end. Many denounced the issue and said it was immoral; others claimed it was racist and xenophobic. None, it seemed, embraced the move. It raises the question, why not? A recent CBS-YouGov poll revealed that a slim majority of the country supported sending illegal immigrants to cities with Democratic government leadership, the Washington Examiner reported. Approximately 51% of respondents felt it was appropriate to transport illegal immigrants, compared to 49% who disapproved. Additionally, the same poll showed that 60% felt it was an \"effective way to handle illegal immigration,\" while 88% believed it \"brought attention to the issue.\"\n",

During Donald Trump’s time at the White House, Democrats claimed he was unstable and a threat to national security. Allegedly, his irrational behavior and incoherent ramblings were proof he couldn’t perform his presidential duties. Rumors began that Democrats would try to use the 25th Amendment to remove him from office. Consider Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). On Oct. 8, 2020, Pelosi commented that Trump suffered from a “dissociation from reality” in response to some of his tweets at the time. She claimed he was in “an altered state” and that his condition “would be funny if it weren’t so deadly.” As a result, Democrats said they would create a commission to determine if they could legally remove Trump from office using the 25th Amendment. The 25th Amendment specifies the procedure for the transfer of presidential power in case of an emergency such as death or disability. Section 4 states that the president can be stripped of his/her power if it is determined that he/she cannot “discharge the powers and duties” of the office. It would require the vice president and members of the Cabinet to give a “written declaration” to the president pro tempore of the Senate and speaker of the House.\n",

The text message was the first time the woman, who is the mother of one of his four children, mentioned to him or his wife directly that she had had an abortion, Walker told NBC News. It marks the latest twist in a controversy in which Walker, who has fashioned himself as a pro-life candidate and critic of absentee fathers, that has rocked his campaign this week. Walker has denied paying for the woman's abortion since her story claiming as much went public. “The first I knew about any of this was when some reporter asked me about an abortion. And I’m like, ‘No, that’s a lie.’ And then I was asked if I paid for an abortion, and I said No. I did not pay for an abortion,” Walker told the outlet. “I’m not saying she did or didn’t have one.

Gavin Newsom (D-CA) announced Friday his plan to call a special session of the state legislature to consider implementing new taxes on oil companies in the face of historically high gas prices.Newsom's action comes as the Biden administration is mulling its own response to the 2 million barrel cuts to daily oil production announced by OPEC+ in recent days. Though national gas prices have steadily declined since their summer peak, prices in California remain roughly $2.50 per gallon above the national average.The governor said Friday night that the session would begin Dec. 5, one month after the midterm elections, and could potentially seek to implement new profit taxes on U.S. oil companies selling in California.\n",

The firm, which is the world’s largest money manager, launched a webpage on Friday committed to “setting the record straight” about how it handles investment decisions and disclosure and its pursuit of environmental, social, and governance standards, also known as ESG. The launch comes just days after Louisiana announced it is divesting all its Treasury funds from BlackRock. “The energy industry plays a crucial role in the economy, and, on behalf of our clients, BlackRock has invested $170 billion in U.S. public energy companies,” the webpage reads. “We are also partnering with energy companies and start-ups to fund new technology and innovations that will power the global economy, now and in the future.”\n"

For those who missed the original story, some background is in order, especially to understand how astonishingly brazen the Democrats are in refusing to hold the IRS accountable. On May 22, the treasury inspector general for tax administration reported that the IRS deliberately destroyed 30 million returns in 2021 so as to relieve a backlog of paper documents in anticipation of a flood of new filings.

Walker has pushed back on the allegations, including that he urged the former girlfriend to get a second abortion, which she says she declined to go through with and led to the end of their relationship.

      "Democratic Arizona gubernatorial candidate Katie Hobbs refused to say if she would support any week-based limit for abortion should she win the governor's mansion but did say that a 15-week ban would be too restrictive. Hobbs, who currently serves as the state's secretary of state, said the decision should not be made by the state while speaking with Major Garrett on CBS News's Face the Nation on Sunday. \"I don't support the 15-week ban. But let me just say that Kari Lake is entirely misconstruing my position on this issue. You and I both know that late-term abortion is extremely rare, and if it's being talked about, it's because something has gone incredibly wrong in a pregnancy,\" Hobbs said when asked if she supports the 15-week abortion ban.\n",

      "Democrats are approaching the North Carolina Senate race like an ex who says they want to get back together after a series of on-again, off-again relationships. They’re ignoring sweet words and watching actions to see if their former special one really means it. That’s led Democrats, for now at least, to be rather cautious about investing significant money and other campaign resources, not to mention hope, on behalf of Democratic nominee Cheri Beasley. She’s running for the Tar Heel State’s open Senate seat, to replace retiring Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC). Beasley, a former chief justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court, faces Rep. Ted Budd (R-NC), a gun store owner in his pre-congressional career whom former President Donald Trump backed early for the GOP Senate nomination. On paper, Democrats seem to have a real shot at winning the North Carolina race. Doing so would help them immensely in their quest for an outright Senate majority, rather than the razor-thin edge they’ve held for nearly two years in the 50-50 chamber thanks to Vice President Kamala Harris’s tiebreaking vote.\n",

The court will decide whether California voters should be allowed to dictate how farmers in Iowa and Minnesota produce pork. If the court sides with California, it could make it even more difficult for consumers to bring home the bacon. The case hinges on the legality of Proposition 12, a ballot measure passed by California voters in 2018. Prop 12’s main advocates were vegan advocacy groups led by the Humane Society of the United States. They sold the policy as a modest reform to farming practices to make the raising of pigs more humane. In practice, it will ban the sale in California of more than 95% of the pork produced in the United States.\n",

      "REPUBLICANS AND BIAS IN MIDTERM POLLS. Republicans always believe the polls are slanted against them. That belief has sometimes caused them to misread big political races. In 2012, for example, a significant number of Republicans convinced themselves that GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney was actually going to defeat incumbent Democratic President Barack Obama. There was a lot of talk about \"unskewing\" the polls. Then Obama beat Romney handily.But there have also been some egregious examples of polling bias, or at least polling mistakes, in the years since Donald Trump entered national politics. On many occasions, pollsters have seemed unable to measure Trump's appeal, especially in state-level polls. In 2016, the Trump vs. Hillary Clinton race, the polls showed Clinton winning in three states critical to Trump's victory — Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. In Wisconsin, the RealClearPolitics average of polls on Election Day showed Clinton winning by 6.5 points. In fact, Trump won by 0.7 points. In Michigan, the polls had Clinton up by 3.6 points. Trump won by 0.3 points. And in Pennsylvania, the polls showed Clinton ahead by 2.1 points. Trump won by 0.7 points.In 2020, the Trump-Joe Biden race, even when the polls got the winner right, they were sometimes off by a lot. In Wisconsin, for example, the final RealClearPolitics average of polls showed Joe Biden winning by 6.7 points. In fact, Biden won by 0.7 points. And no Republican will forget the Washington Post-ABC News poll, published in late October, that showed Biden 17 points ahead of Trump. It was crazy — an embarrassment that pollsters should not soon forget.\n"

Hobbs has refused to debate Lake, who was slated to appear for a solo interview with Arizona PBS on Wednesday. However, revelations surfaced that the outlet agreed to an interview with Hobbs on Oct. 18 and had not notified the Arizona Citizens Clean Election Commission, with whom it was partnering on debates and the interview. \"As the CEC's broadcast partner, PBS' actions are a slap in the face to the commissioners of the CEC and a betrayal of their efforts to put on an actual debate,\" Lake's campaign wrote in a statement.\n",

Thiel reportedly told the Senate Leadership Fund, which is aligned with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), that he would make the multimillion-dollar investment if the Senate Leadership Fund could invest the same amount, according to Axios. The Senate Leadership Fund apparently said it would be interested in the deal but hasn't yet raised the money. The deal would come out to $10 million in total split between Thiel and the Senate Leadership Fund and would fund advertising during the crucial last three weeks of the election. A recent CBS poll showed that Masters is only 3 points behind Kelly, sparking fresh interest in the race. Thiel backed both Masters and Ohio's Republican Senate candidate J.D. Vance with $15 million each in the primaries and said earlier this month he'd stop pumping money into the Vance campaign as the Republican seems poised for victory.\n"

      "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has publicly rejected the notion that democracies should restrict their trade relationships with Communist China in response to Beijing's degradation of human lives and international security. Scholz did so by observing on Tuesday that \"globalization has been a success story that enabled prosperity for many people. We must defend it. Decoupling is the wrong answer.\" Scholz happily ignores the fact that China is now the world's most existential threat to that rule-of-law-based capitalist globalization. Instead, Chinese President Xi Jinping seeks to replace that global order with a feudal mercantile order ruled by Beijing. But Scholz's latest hat tip to Beijing is just the tip of the iceberg. According to Politico and Bloomberg, he will become the first Western leader to meet with Xi following the latter's coronation for a third term in office later this month. Scholz and the leaders of the European Union's three next largest economies — France, Italy, and Spain — were invited to Beijing earlier this summer. Those invitations reflect China's priority interest in wooing European powers away from U.S. efforts to confront its various aggressions. Scholz's visit is a major diplomatic coup for China and for Xi personally. It will lend high prestige and credibility to Xi's effort to present himself as the 21st-century successor to Mao Zedong. And coming alongside near unprecedented U.S.-China tensions, the visit can only be viewed as a stinging German rebuke to Washington.\n",

Biden described Putin as \"a rational actor who's miscalculated significantly.\"Biden was not asked about the appropriateness of making the \"Armageddon\" statement at a small Democratic Party fundraiser in Manhattan, rather than in, say, an address to the nation.

Biden and interviewer Jake Tapper spent most of the time on Ukraine and international affairs, with brief discussions of midterm elections, a possible recession, and Biden's 2024 plans.Republicans would be heartened to know there was one question about the Hunter Biden scandal but disappointed to know that it revealed nothing. Tapper introduced the topic by noting reports that Justice Department prosecutors think they have enough evidence \"to charge your son Hunter for tax crimes and a false statement about a gun purchase.\" That led to the question: \"Personally and politically, how do you react to that?\"\n",

Last week, in the latest of many gaffes during his term, Biden gave a speech from a Volvo truck plant in Maryland. \"Let me start with two words: Made in America,\" Biden said.

The government hoped to have more people boosted in anticipation of a rise of COVID-19 cases going into the holiday season, purchasing over 170 million doses of Moderna's and Pfizer-BioNTech's updated boosters in advance, but public interest has appeared to wane as only a small percentage of the roughly 226 million people who have completed their primary vaccination series have received the new booster, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data released Thursday. \"We’re doing everything we can as an administration to stay ahead of this virus,\" said White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha earlier this week. \"If we all do our part — not just us in the administration, but Congress and the American people — I remain incredibly confident we can manage this virus for this fall and winter with less suffering, and we can have a safe and healthy holiday season ahead.\"\n",

      "A longtime Democratic operative testified he fabricated the sourcing behind a claim about Trump’s 2016 campaign that ended up in British ex-spy Christopher Steele’s discredited dossier. Charles Dolan, an ally of Bill and Hillary Clinton who spent many years doing work with Russian officials and businesses, testified Thursday about his business relationship with Igor Danchenko — the main source for Steele’s anti-Trump dossier. Danchenko has been charged with five false statements, including one related to allegedly concealing from the FBI his August 2016 email exchange with Dolan about information that Danchenko then passed along to Steele and which ended up in the dossier. Dolan confessed Thursday he made up the sourcing for a claim that made it into the dossier and that he had actually gotten the tidbit not from an insider acquaintance of his but from watching TV. The Russian had sent Dolan an August 2016 email telling him he was “working on a related project against Trump” and asked the Clinton-allied businessman for “any rumor, thought, or allegation” on Paul Manafort’s departure as Trump’s campaign manager.\n",

Pelosi ultimately decided to focus specifically on one incident, a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and pushed to complete the proceedings by the end of the year.\n",

Speaking from the site of the Purple Line Extension Project in Los Angeles, the president said the infrastructure bill is the “largest investment in public transit in the history of America,” noting that the project extension of the LA Metro’s Purple Line is funded in part by the infrastructure bill and local taxpayer dollars. “The last eight years or so, American infrastructure – bridges, rails, everything – you know what we were rated in the world? Number 13,” Biden said Thursday. “We should be ranked number one.”\n"

The move seemed to be a response to pleas from border state politicians to stem the tide of illegal migration. “These actions make clear that there is a lawful and orderly way for Venezuelans to enter the United States, and lawful entry is the only way,” DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. “Those who attempt to cross the southern border of the United States illegally will be returned to Mexico and will be ineligible for this process in the future.

And the next few weeks will play a crucial role in how this convoluted and salacious story ends. The federal agents who have been investigating Hunter Biden believe that they have unearthed enough evidence to charge him with crimes related to tax fraud and lying during his purchase of a handgun, according to numerous reports. Republicans in Congress, meanwhile, seek to recapture the majority in early November and turn the investigative committees' attention from the previous president to the current one. The midterm elections will determine whether Republicans get the chance to uncover wider Biden family corruption to go along with possible indictments against Hunter. Although the Justice Department indicting the son of a sitting president would be a major development, the bigger questions remain whether the DOJ has been considering more significant charges tied to money laundering or foreign lobbying and whether investigators have been looking into the national security implications of Hunter Biden’s overseas business dealings, especially his association with businessmen linked to Chinese intelligence.\n",

A new poll from the Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa puts Grassley, 89, with 46% of the vote and Franken at 43% among likely voters. The poll surveyed 804 Iowans over the age of 18, 620 of whom are likely voters in the Nov. 8 midterm election. It was conducted Oct. 9 through 12 and has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points for all Iowans and 3.9 for the likely voters. “It says to me that Franken is running a competent campaign and has a shot to defeat the seemingly invincible Chuck Grassley — previously perceived to be invincible,” said J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co, which conducted the poll, told the Des Moines Register.\n",

Speaking at a forum at Harvard University, Cheney stressed the subpoena, which the House select committee approved unanimously last week, is for Trump's testimony and for documents related to events surrounding the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. \"So we'll be issuing a subpoena shortly, both for his testimony under oath as well as for documents. And we'll take whatever next steps we have to take assuming that he will fulfill his legal obligation and honor the subpoena, but if that doesn't happen, we'll take the steps after that,\" Cheney said.\n",

But not all candidates are stepping up to the podium. While some Republican candidates trailing their opponents in polling have been eager to participate in debates, a handful of Democratic front-runners have been wary of facing their GOP counterparts on the stage. As a result, the debate schedule between now and Election Day has been left uncertain as candidates have either resisted committing to debates or have dropped out altogether. In the New Hampshire Senate race, Republican candidate Don Bolduc has committed to appear in at least seven debates against Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-NH), who has shied away from facing her opponent. Hassan backed out of a debate last week after requesting organizers to allow candidates to appear separately onstage.\n",

There is no legal justification for this presidential usurpation of the constitutional spending power, which is reserved exclusively for Congress.”\n",

Gavin Newsom (D-CA) has been blaming the oil industry for high gas prices in California, but experts say the evidence just isn’t there.\"You'd have to explain why [oil companies are] ripping people off 50% more in California than the rest of the world and why they only choose to do it now,\" economist David Kreutzer of the Institute for Energy Research told Fox News. \"The big problem is we have policies in place, especially in California, that make it difficult to expand supply. When you have these rules and regulations that prevent markets from responding as robustly as they could, then prices are going to go up.”While housing, food, energy, and almost anything else are more expensive in California, gas prices are particularly out of step with the rest of the nation at about $2 more a gallon despite being an oil drilling state. The national average on Tuesday was $3.85, compared to $5.94 in California, AAA reported.\n",

After all, a Democrat has held the congressional seat that encompasses Pittsburgh for well over 100 years. For the last 28 years, it was held by Democratic Rep. Mike Doyle, who announced his retirement last fall. But this is a wave election year favoring Republican candidates. And, just as importantly, it is a race between Democratic state Rep. Summer Lee and Republican Plum Borough Council President Mike Doyle (no relation to the retiring congressman). The district is so blue that Joe Biden carried it by 20 points just two years ago — for context, no House Republican represents a district that’s bluer than Biden +11. So why have the alarm bells sounded here? One reason is that Lee, an unabashed supporter of the Democratic Socialists of America, is underperforming. The other is Doyle’s doggedness in going to places Republicans don’t go looking for votes.\n",

      "Even in the immediate aftermath of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, sending the abortion issue back to the states, the share of voters who listed abortion as their most important issue for the midterm elections never hit the double digits. Since peaking at 8% in Gallup’s July poll, the share of voters prioritizing abortion has halved, giving way to the highest portion of voters prioritizing economic issues since the Obama administration.Democrats have lamented that the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization (and perhaps more importantly, Politico’s publication of a draft opinion leak) may have come too early to staunch the electoral bleeding the president’s party may face come November. And it’s no wonder. Unlike inflation, which affects every single person, abortion is, now more than ever, an avoidable issue, even for women.When the Supreme Court decided Roe nearly half a century ago, women had nowhere near the proactive powers over her reproductive and sexual autonomy as she does now. The Supreme Court was not a full decade out from legalizing contraception nationwide, and those contraception methods included: first-generation, high-estrogen oral contraceptives, which had a much higher risk of blood clotting than anything in the current market; the copper IUD, which, while highly effective, can result in much heavier and painful periods; and physical barrier methods such as diaphragms and condoms, which leave room for human error.\n",

A Monmouth University poll out Thursday found women to be evenly split between Democrats and Republicans on the generic ballot, 38% to 38%, an 8-point decrease since August, when the poll found women preferred that Democrats over Republicans be in control of Congress, 46% to 29%. The findings come as Republicans focus on rising inflation and economic concerns under President Joe Biden as their closing argument. The poll found the number of people who rate inflation as extremely important has increased from 37% in September to 46% this month.\n",

The 2022 midterm elections are set to be held in less than a month, and Democrats are facing an uphill battle against the Republican Party. While the former president has attended four fundraisers in August and September, some Democrats argue he has not utilized his appeal enough in this year's elections, according to the Hill. “I think a lot of people have said, ‘Where’s Obama?’” one Democratic strategist stated. “He shouldn’t just be the closer.

Mnuchin, who served as treasury secretary under former President Donald Trump, will testify for the defense of Barrack, a Trump fundraiser who is on trial on charges of illegally acting as a foreign agent for the United Arab Emirates. U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan stated Thursday that the UAE was a \"very important client\" for Mnuchin, as he had started a private equity fund after leaving office in 2021, according to Reuters. Because of Mnuchin's connection to the UAE, there was \"some indication of bias\" from Mnuchin's testimony due to the UAE likely not wanting a jury to convict Barrack, Cogan said. Despite this, Cogan will limit prosecutors' ability to detail the \"mind-boggling\" amounts of money involved in Mnuchin's dealings with the UAE.\n",

Sacoolas, 45, pleaded guilty to death by careless driving in order to avoid harsher sentencing under a death by dangerous driving charge, according to the BBC. Death by careless driving carries a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment, while death by dangerous driving, prior to June 28, carries a maximum of 14 years in prison, according to the U.K. sentencing council.

In August 2019, Harry Dunn was killed after being hit outside a U.S. military base by Sacoolas's car, which was driving on the wrong side of the road. The U.S. asserted diplomatic immunity on her behalf, allowing her to leave the country 19 days after the incident. The Trump and Biden administrations have maintained the decision, despite lobbying from the Dunn family and U.K.\n",

      "His ego is huge, and he wants to be not just the 45th president but the 47th too.Yet, former President Donald Trump seems to know his place in history, and it’s behind the greatest golfer ever. In Vignettes & Vino, a fun story and recipe book by former White House spokesman Brian Morgenstern and his wife, Teresa, we learn just how important fellow golfer Jack Nicklaus and his 117 wins are to Trump.Morgenstern recalled a trip on Air Force One when “the president asked us whether we thought it was harder to be president or harder to do what Jack Nicklaus had done. Staff Secretary Derek Lyons was quick to reply that being president of the United States was harder. President Trump smirked, shrugged, and said, ‘I don’t know. Eighteen majors. I mean, come on. There have been forty-five presidents. There’s only one Jack.’”\n"

      "In yet another example of President Joe Biden failing America and leaving the country flat-footed on the world stage, OPEC decided to cut oil production by 2 million barrels a day — a move Biden cast as “shortsighted.” He also called it “a disappointment.” But what Biden really means is that with the midterm elections right around the corner, he and the Democrats are in big trouble. Gas prices now sit at $3.92 per gallon, more than $1.50 higher than when Biden first took office. And according to a recent Rasmussen poll, 86% of likely voters are concerned about high gas prices. OPEC’s decision is expected to drive up prices even more. Biden’s scrambled, incoherent, politically motivated response is to release 10 million more barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. (For reference, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve had 638 million barrels when Biden took office — now it has 416 million.) Additionally, Biden is poised to lift sanctions on Venezuela so that it can produce more oil, though this would do little more than empower Nicolas Maduro, the country’s brutal dictator, and contribute to pollution in the country.\n",

The Supreme Court’s ruling in Roe v. Wade, which established a national right to abortion in 1973, galvanized Republicans in opposition to the decision for decades. That all changed after the high court held in June that each state can formulate its own abortion laws, an outcome conservatives celebrated but that also exposed an intraparty rift on one of the most polarizing issues in American politics.\n",

That is the conclusion of a Government Accountability Office report released this week. On day one of his administration, Biden ended former President Donald Trump’s \"Remain in Mexico\" policy. He also instituted a 100-day moratorium on deportations and stopped returning unaccompanied minors to Mexico through Title 42. Biden soon extended the Title 42 loophole to families as well. The impact of Biden’s catch-and-release policies was swift and clear. Monthly apprehensions of immigrants illegally crossing the southern border rose from 73,994 in December 2020 to 173,277 in March 2021. As the GAO notes, for all of fiscal 2021, the arrest of illegal immigrants between ports of entry rose 300%.\n",

Dina Titus (D-NV) in the 1st Congressional District, notices the difference between past, somewhat lackluster GOP efforts to appeal to Latino voters, and believes this year’s robust and comprehensive campaign is light years ahead of past efforts.\n",

      "The White House on Monday defended President Joe Biden's claims of shoring up the economy while slashing the federal budget deficit, saying the \"economy turned back on\" under his watch. Biden spoke earlier in the day before the Democratic National Committee, saying he cut the annual national deficit from $2.8 trillion to $1.4 trillion in his first year. But a reporter challenged that notion during the afternoon press briefing, saying the reduction can be entirely attributed to expiring pandemic spending, which is more than offset by future spending to transfer student loan debt. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre defended the administration's record on the economy, bringing up the 2017 Republican-backed tax cuts that were unfunded and then touting the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan for stimulating a recovery.\n",

Yet recently, Fetterman has tried to shed this reputation, reinvent himself, and promote himself as tough on crime. Pennsylvanians shouldn't believe the facade. In addition to his penchant for freeing murderers and enthusiasm for \"emptying the jails,\" Fetterman is also an ardent supporter of left-wing, radical Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, the official whose policies have led to a record number of murders and violent crime. Since Krasner was elected in 2017, violent crimes have steadily risen each year he has been in office. In 2020, the city missed a homicide record by one death. In 2021, violent crime exploded, and the city set a new record for murder in its over two-century history. Crime has become so out of control that all of the city's leaders have reached their wit's end trying to restore order. Yet, despite Krasner's horrific record, he has earned high praise from none other than John \"Free All Criminals\" Fetterman. In May 2021, Fetterman tweeted how much he appreciated Larry Krasner.\n",

Simultaneously, the debate elevates Crist's scandal-embroiled campaign that was already handicapped by a $100 million fundraising disadvantage. But the national implications of a good performance are difficult to dismiss given DeSantis's reelection seems almost certain.DeSantis is expected to underscore the economy, education, and immigration during his hourlong debate with Crist, starting at 7 p.m. Monday at Fort Pierce's Sunrise Theater, according to aides.

The analysis grades governors on their fiscal policies from a limited-government viewpoint; the higher the grade, the more a governor has cut taxes and spending.

      "AUSTIN, Texas — Former President Donald Trump's claims over the past two years that the 2020 election was \"stolen\" have certain Republicans convinced their votes will not count in 2022, causing them to second-guess if voting in the midterm elections is worthwhile. As early voting commenced in Texas Monday, conservatives interviewed by the Washington Examiner were still convinced that Democrats stole the previous election. Trump has continued to state this falsehood, including at a rally in Robstown, Texas, over the weekend. Not only are the \"Make America Great Again\" faithful convinced they've been cheated — they have lost faith in the democratic system, and some may even boycott the polls, a move that could end up costing the Republican Party the votes it needs to win key congressional districts and ultimately its chances of winning a majority and impeaching Biden.\n",

      "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) knocked her party for failing to even try to court support among Latino voters. While underscoring her belief that Democrats have been hemorrhaging support among male voters, Ocasio-Cortez raised Democratic failures to make inroads with Latinos as an example of how the party has been dragging its feet in the race to cultivate support among segments of working-class voters more broadly. \"We're shedding men, and it is important that we don't paint this with a broad brush because when we look into this, that is what is going to help us inform a strategy,\" she argued on the progressive Pod Save America podcast without elaborating on why she believes Democrats are losing men.\n",

      "President Joe Biden reportedly instructed the Democratic National Committee to pony up $18 million to boost his party's House and Senate campaigns just two weeks before the midterm elections as Republicans hope to win control of one or both chambers of Congress. Ten million dollars were directed to be given to House and Senate Democratic campaign arms immediately, and another $8 million was added as a commitment through fundraising efforts, according to CNN, citing a Democratic official. The last-ditch cash infusion is being reported as Republicans hope to snag victories in key contests in states such as Pennsylvania and Georgia, and one net gain would give them back power over the Senate. When it comes to the House, Republicans are heavy favorites. The GOP has an 81% chance of winning control of the House, according to election forecaster FiveThirtyEight.\n",

      "California is poised to overtake Germany as the world’s fourth-largest economy. It will help Gov. Gavin Newsom prepare for his presidential run in 2024, but it won’t do much to help the everyday Californians struggling to get by while Newsom’s ultrawealthy base prospers.Newsom issued a statement boasting about the news, claiming that “while critics often say California’s best days are behind us, reality proves otherwise.” Newsom said the state would be “doubling down on renewables and clean energy” and that he feels “tremendous pride in California’s resilience, leadership, and our formula for success.”Of course, part of the reason California is passing Germany is that country’s commitment to the very energy policies California is now embracing. Germany’s gross domestic product is projected to shrink in 2023 due to rising energy prices after the country’s commitment to renewable energy left it reliant on Russian natural gas. California is undoubtedly headed down the same road, with the current grid unable to support the state’s energy demands, a problem that is going to become worse in the coming years.\n",

      "The Republican National Committee’s dismissal of Jan. 6 as “normal political discourse” shows the depth to which the party has fallen during the Trump era, said a one-time member of the House GOP leadership, former Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma. Watts, from 1995-03, represented a House district based in southern Oklahoma City, stretching down to the Texas state line. Watts became the most prominent black Republican of his era and often was a prominent public GOP face in political and policy fights with President Bill Clinton and congressional Democrats. A former star quarterback at the University of Oklahoma, Watts was elected to the House in the historic Republican Revolution class of 1994, which ushered in the first GOP majority in 40 years. Watts, in an interview with the podcast Pro Politics with Zac McCrary, said he always saw himself as a Jack Kemp-style Republican, focused on economic growth and opportunity for all people.\n",

      "House Freedom Caucus Chairman Scott Perry (R-PA) is ramping up a push for rules changes in the next Congress as the conservative group looks to flex its muscle ahead of midterm elections in which Republicans are expected to take back the majority in the lower chamber. Last week, the Freedom Caucus released a 54-page packet cautioning new lawmakers to lower their expectations for committee assignments and how much of a legislative impact they will have in their first term. Perry said he feels the incoming Congress should take a more bottom-up approach, noting key conservatives in the group have spoken to candidates about pushing for changes as they prepare to take office. “We've had great conversations, obviously, with candidates from across the board. We're all focused on winning the majority, as you know, and you know, but the general theme of everything we're hearing from our constituents, from candidates, you know, just across the board is, if you keep doing things the same way, you're gonna keep getting the same outcomes,” he told the Washington Examiner in an interview.\n",

      "The Justice Department suffered an epic smackdown last night when an Alabama-based federal district judge quashed its abusive subpoena against the Alabama chapter of the Eagle Forum. Still, Judge Liles Burke left one important thing unsaid: The First Amendment should be openly, not merely implicitly, defended. Through an assistant district attorney, the department had subpoenaed five years of voluminous records from the Eagle Forum of Alabama, a conservative group that had backed a law outlawing sex-change procedures on children. The Eagle Forum was in no way a party to the case at hand, which involved a constitutional challenge, backed by the Biden administration, to that new Alabama law. In essence, the subpoena was a bullying maneuver to punish the Forum and send a message that mere support for such a law would trigger harassment from the U.S. government. The subpoena was abusive on three fronts. Judge Burke did a good job of castigating the Justice Department on the first two fronts, but he left the final front unaddressed.\n",

      "Alaska Republicans voted to censure Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) on Monday, denouncing him for backing incumbent Sen. Lisa Murkowski in her reelection bid against Kelly Tshibaka, who was endorsed by the state party. The Alaska Republican Party passed a resolution on Monday denouncing the minority leader for “divisive and misleading statements” after McConnell allocated millions of dollars from the Senate Leadership Fund toward attack ads against Tshibaka. The resolution passed the party with a 49-8 vote. “Much of the financial support from the Senate Leadership Fund has been used for malicious political attack ads targeted at our endorsed candidate, Kelly Tshibaka, that are gross distortions of fact,” the party wrote in the resolution. “We request the Senate Leadership Fund immediately stop the attack ads against Kelly Tshibaka and discontinue the support of all other opposing candidates.”\n",

      "STERLING HEIGHTS, Michigan — When the Department of Energy announced $2.8 billion in funding for electric vehicle battery cell manufacturing, Michigan Democrats were shocked that none of that money would be coming here. Michigan is still the largest car-producing state in the country and the home to the only mine in the nation producing nickel, one of the crucial components of electric vehicle batteries. The states receiving the funding include Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, and North Dakota. This means that the funds will go to predominantly foreign-owned, nonunionized automakers in what Fortune magazine calls the \"Battery Belt.\" The announcement came one month after President Joe Biden had been seen at the Detroit Auto Show holding hands with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. He took a victory lap over his electric-vehicle push and the billions of dollars in investments that would be going to new battery plants funded by millions in government grants.\n",

      "HARRISBURG, Pennsylvania — Lt. Gov. John Fetterman (D) and Dr. Mehmet Oz (R) are set to debate Tuesday evening as they jockey for an open Senate seat in this pivotal swing state, with their much-anticipated televised slugfest poised to decide the balance of power on Capitol Hill.The impact of congressional debates in midterm elections is typically overblown. But Democrats and Republicans agree Oz versus Fetterman in Pennsylvania’s capital city, beginning at 8 p.m. EDT, two weeks to the minute before the polls close on Election Day, is a major exception to that political rule. Fetterman is still recovering from a stroke suffered in May, and Oz is a recent New Jersey transplant without a long history in Republican politics.That leaves voters plenty to assess this evening in the only debate both contenders to succeed retiring Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) agreed to, although Oz sought more and Fetterman refused or made demands his Republican challenger found unacceptable. Their faceoff could be the decisive moment in this neck-and-neck campaign, one that not only determines partisan control of this seat but which party holds the Senate majority in the 118th Congress.\n",
