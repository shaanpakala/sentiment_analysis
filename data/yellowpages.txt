I respect the journalists of the New York Times. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for their management, especially when it comes to customer service and billing. I have been trying to correct a billing problem since May. My billing had been done by credit card with no problems until then.After several attempts to correct the problem with Customer Service, I wrote to Yasmin Namini, VP Circulation Department. That was July 28. I canceled my subscription and have yet to hear from Ms. Namini or her staff. I am still receiving bills. This problem appears to be stuck to my shoe with no satisfactory solution in sight.

When something goes wrong, it is easy to feel at a disadvantage. Pelham Plumbing & Heating takes my anxiety away. My first experience with Pelham was when the bathroom sink faucet had to be changed. One very expensive faucet for another. I had no idea what I was dealing with, but I called them up, someone came the same day and just like that I had a beautiful faucet that didn't splash me when turned on. Today, it was the toilet that started leaking and the backward shower faucet that I just couldn't tolerate any longer. Same-day service and the nicest, most skilled plumber. It was a very good experience. I got my repairs made, the cost was reasonable and I don't feel victimized. From now on, I'm going to ask for Junior, if possible, to make any more changes I may find, and I recommend you ask for Junior too.

This past Saturday I was hosting a birthday party for my daughter. While we were out on Friday my water heater blew and it flooded the place. Not only did the plumbers come on friday night to hook up the new water heater, but they vacuumed up the water and dried everything up with some kind of heat blower. The party went on as scheduled. THANK YOU GUYS!!!  -Megan

Thank you, thank you, thank you- your wonderful guys, Nick and Robert, rescued me...I had total anxiety about the water valve in my bathroom which was causing a leak to the floor below. Nick was so careful as he fixed "the packing" (whatever that is), not causing any damage to the surrounding marble squares. The "Franklin Report" is right on with all accolades.

He found the cause of my problem to be the diverter plug, it was removed and I have not had any trouble since. I can now be clean in comfort.  Thank you all very much.

Thank you so much for everything you did to expedite the gas being restored to my apartment. I appreciate your time in explaining everything that needed to be done to expedite the process, including all your calls to my assistant. You kept us posted on the progress of the Buildings Department and the Architect and were so helpful in many different ways. Thank you. Thank you!

Many times people write to complain when they think something might not be right, however, we forget to say "thank you" when things do go right. Just wanted to let you know how much we appreciated the professional and pleasant manner of the three men that came last week to do a very dirty and difficult repair on our pipes encased in cement. They worked hard and long to get things back to normal and were so very pleasant.

I also wanted to share with you my experience working with Vlad and his helper, Aris. Vlad and Aris should be commended for their fine work. Each took it upon himself to ensure that their work was done to the highest standard. Moreover, it was clear to all of us that they took a personal interest in this project and ensured (to the extent possible) that our tenants were kept apprised of scheduling as well as keeping a sharp eye on cleanliness while working in the tenant's apartments. In spite of sometimes difficult tasks at hand, they always maintained a good work ethic, pleasant disposition, professional attitude and a sense of humor. I don't often take time to write such a review but felt you should know about the caliber of your men. Bravo.

To all the skilled contractors who worked on the LOBBY RENOVATION PROJECT, we thank you. The inconvenience was minimal, the housekeeping efforts were grand, and we now have a lobby to be proud of.

This is to commend the excellent work done by your people today in installing a new commode at our apartment.  they were an obliging team, very fast, courteous and tidy.

I have recently completed extensive renovation on my apartment at 1040 Park Avenue. The job required one and one-half years and a multitude of contractors before its completion. After considerable dissatisfaction with other plumbing contractors, my superintendent recommended Fred Smith, our building plumbing company. James Keeney was assigned to my job. All my plumbing concerns and problems were resolved at that point. Mr. Keeney is both knowledgeable and receptive to his clientele. Under his directive your company has proved most efficient and reliable. Your technicians were excellent and Mr. Keeney particularly outstanding. I have and will continue to recommend the Fred Smith organization and Mr. Keeney and intend to use you for all future work.

My wife and I have used your services twice now in the past year.  I cannot begin to tell you how much we appreciate the quality of your service - from the scheduling, quick response, the great technicians .... and just generally  how well organized your business is run.  In this day and age...it is a rarity.  An additional note ---in past years, I had worked as an architect and an interior designer -- dealing with literally hundreds and hundreds of contractors and subcontractors in the NYC area...and Fred Smith Plumbing easily tops the list.

I wanted to express my thanks and appreciation for the prompt and efficient service I received from Fred Smith. My in laws were in town last week and I needed a plumber immediately the day before they arrived. My company had worked with them previously so I knew they would be my best bet. They had a technician at our home within 3 hours of my call, and fixed the problem in our bathroom in just 20 minutes. I was very impressed with the service provided and will recommend to colleagues and friends.

I have only used Fred Smith once before, but was pleased so when I was having plumbing problems, I gave them a call. The repairman that you all sent over was familiar with the system and he was also very courteous.

I choose PHD General Contracting, Inc to add on a bathroom to my house and after seeing the excellent job that they are doing I asked them if they also do roofing and they put a new roof to my house that changed the whole exterior look of my house and gave it a contemporary new look.

When we first moved in, PHD General Contracting, Inc managed the kitchen, straightening out the floors and later on did everything from a leaky basement, to renovating after the leaky basement leaked water. Good friends of our also had them do a tear down. What is great about them is that they have really good financial controls. Everything is done by change order and you can see where you are on the project. Also their subs are reliable and nice people too. They are not expensive, but in my experience, construction is one area where you don't want it to go to a low cost bidder .

Aladdin plumbing puts customers first. I have an older faucet and was unsure of how to fix it. I was pretty certain I needed to purchase an entire new faucet. I reached out to Aladdin and Erik was so kind and offered me professional, HONEST advice and took care of me. It turned out that I only needed to replace a small part - not the entire faucet! Despite me living in another state - he still took the time to research my faucet issue and he located the replacement part for me!!!! Outstanding customer service. I highly recommend Aladdin Plumbing Corp for any plumbing issue. If you're looking for a great experience, go with Aladdin. Kudos to their entire team!

Erik Gitli of Aladdin Plumbing and his crew did an excellent job installing the waste and water lines for a second floor washer and dryer at my Bayridge home.  I had contacted 3 plumbers in order to get estimates.  Erik came to my home and we discussed the job.  He was very responsive to emails regarding the specifications for the washer and the size of the required drain lines.  While his quote for the estimate was similar to the other plumbers, you could tell that he really cares about the quality of his work.  His crew arrived on time and had to cut into a cast iron pipe and ran a new cast iron waste line for the new drain and new copper water lines.  They were efficient, explained what they needed to do and finished in one day.  They left the area spotless.  If you need any plumbing work, contact Erik at 718 783 4621 www.aladdinplumbingcorp.com

Rafael Tech # 340 was polite, professional and very courteous.  Had a sweet bedside manner for a very stressful circumstance.

Keep up fixing the messes and spreading the joy! God bless!

Perhaps due to the cold snap and time of year RR was delayed in providing service but I kept the faith. A very nice gentleman (Matt #470) arrived at my house on January 1st at about 7:30 pm. For almost the next three hours he worked very hard in the crawl space of my house to resolve my plumbing  problems (frozen waste pipes). He kept me informed along the way as to what the problem was and what he was doing to fix it. Not ONCE did Matt complain about the day (new year's day) the time, temperature or working conditions. Never once did I sense that Matt was giving this job less then 100 % of his time and attention. Matt is a wonderful representative of RR.

I remember the first time I phoned their office. It was a real person taking genuine interest in ceiling repairs I needed to get done as soon as possible and not an automated massage system. It was raining continuously for 3-4 days already and I wasn’t sure if anyone could fix the ceiling leakage so quick. They did it in less than 4 hours after I placed a request.

If you are looking for expert plumbers in New York City – look no further. Handyman at your service team is THE company you will ever need. This is NOT an advertizing – I am speaking out of personal experience. Dan W. (he wouldn't tell me his last name) is an amazing professional, very knowledgeable and helpful. He also gave me a couple of money-saving tips regarding hot water usage!

I had a great experience starting even with scheduling, then to the dispatcher and finally with the tech.   Very easy to schedule my appointment and there seemed to be a lot of availability.  Then the morning of the dispatchers were great giving me a pretty accurate time of arrival for the tech within the scheduled window and didn't mind doing so.  (I've dealt with other companies who just make it seem as if you are bothering them when calling for an update on arrival).  Then the Tech PJ who arrived was patient, listened to my issues, was thorough, and did a great job fixing the issue. He was a complete professional! Total 5 star service.

These guys are great!  I had not called Roto-Rooter since October 5th, 1995 and needed them for an emergency plumbing repair.  They still had all my information on file 23 years later.  They gave me an appointment window but the technician was there even before the start of the window and had my repair fixed perfectly in about 2.5 hours.  Very professional!  They kept mess to a minimum while working and completely cleaned up anything that got messy after they were done (which was not much at all).  To paraphrase Dos Equis commercials...I don't need plumbing often, but when I do....I call Roto-Rooter!  Thanks to Claudio (#4540) and his partner (whose name I've forgotten, so sorry)

Had sewer lines clogged and called Roto Rooter.  Was most fortunate to have been sent Technician Reuben (#3309) to do the job.  The obstruction was way out about 80 feet, and in a short amount of time Reuben successful cleaned out the line.  He was courteous, dependable, and extremely conscientious.  It was a delight having such a highly professional and technician handling this job.  Would highly recommend Roto Rooter to all, and have nothing but praise for their outstanding employee, Reuben, Technician #3309.

Peter #2031 and Andy #2026 were outstanding. Peter was professional, accommodating, and polite. He agreed to go beyond normal service hours to get the job done. I would use these gentleman again and recommend RotoRooter.

This is my second time using Roto-Rooter and I am very pleased. Both calls I had two different techs, they were both pleasant, professional, punctual and kept clean working areas during and after the service calls.  When it comes to home repairs it’s always a gamble, I 200% trust my plumbing needs  to Roto-Rooter

Cleaning out drains is not rocket science. Anyone can do it with the correct equipment.I came home to find an unpleasant flood in the basement. Called the first number which happened to be rotor rooter. While I thought they would be pricey, I didn't think it would be highway robbery. For literally ten minutes of actual work, I paid 453.00!!!!. The technician spent a lot of time pressuring me to get them to clean up the mess and indicated that the insurance would pick up the tab. Perhaps this is the reason for the exorbitant price.  On principal,  will never use any rotor rooter service.!!!!!

Superior service from Erick, Tech # 0271.  Professional, friendly, thorough.  This was an absolutely disgusting, unexpected mess we had, and RotoRooter responded faster than I could have imagined.  Price was competitive, Erick is truly a great asset to this company.

the receptionist was friendly and kept in touch with us until the repairman arrived. Louis Sunra was a fantastic help. Came on time. He quoted the price, explained the work and went to it right away.  Finished the job and even cleaned up after himself.  A pleasure to do business with.

Fixed  my gas leak at a much better rate than the competitors.  They didn't try to sell me anything i didn't need and were honest about the whole process.   I had another plumber that wanted to replace my entire gas line and said it wouldn't pass inspection otherwise.  Over all I'm happy with their fair pricing and honest work.  Thanks for the good business

I had two opportunities to have Junior make calls to my house this winter. RR promptly answered my calls, and sent him promptly each time, keeping me informed on his ETA. Junior was very knowledgeable and kept me informed of his progress and further problems as he proceeded. I had no qualms when I had to call a second time that he would fix the problem. I would definitely recommend RR to anyone who needed a plumber.

Allan arrived promptly.  I was particularly pleased with how quickly they were able to respond.  He  was very courteous, informative, and helpful.  Quickly diagnosed and resolved the issue.  Scheduled follow up to further handle the issues.  The follow up was also most helpful.  A very knowledgeable rep named Jimmy advised around camera diagnostics and a jet service that would be a good near-medium term solution.  He also advised around the longer-term fix for my line.  I felt I had the info and options to move forward.  I would recommend that you work with Roto Rooter for plumbing issues.

I called Roto Rooter for my elderly aunt who is vision impaired.  They came right away and the worker was so helpful and kind to my aunt.   He took everything out from under the sink and offered to put everything back for her.  Very considerate.  I would recommend this company highly.  Thank you for being so thoughtful to an elderly handicapped lady. I used this service on 3/23/14

I give Roto Rooter 5 stars!   12/09/13 kateq886@gmail.comI hired a handyman to fix a simple leak in my bathub faucet. Well it wasn't successful. He tells me that he has to break down the tiles to find the leak. My gut feeling tells me that he doesn't know what he's doing and I had to pay him $75 for trying and he left my home without a care. I had a restless night sleep thinking about a possible major project and money. The next day I googled plumbers with a good reputation and I noticed that Roto Rooter has a A+ BBB rating and read wonderful reviews with their customers so I called Roto Rooter. Along came Walter, the courteous technician 17546207. I explained the problem to Walter and he did a great job! There was a part that he needed and he went out of his way to go to Reimen's Hardware store to get the part. When he completed the job he kindly called me to check out his work and to get my approval. Walter not only got my approval, he gave me peace of mind. Walter is a true professional and Roto Rooter should be very proud and lucky to have Walter working with a great company! Yes, I would spread the message if you want the job done right, call Roto Rooter!!

I have used Roto Rooter several times as a home owner, most recently yesterday.  They were prompt, and got the job done right.  And they gave us a 6 month guarantee.  I had to call them back the last time I used them and the plumber came back, worked just as hard as the first time, cleared the drain again, and honored the guarantee.  What more could u want from a plumber!

I especially want to recommend James 3095. He was very helpful and a pleasure to work with.

My experience with Roto-Rooter could not have been worse. Not only were they careless (e.g., significant collateral damage) but they were non-responsive (e.g., did not return to finish work or pickup equipment). In addition, their invoice did not reflect actual work completed, which resulted in almost $4,000 in extra charges (e.g., charged for a dumpster, additional air movers and dehumidifiers, door/floor/baseboard removal that did not occur). When the issue was raised with the General Manager, I was threatened with a lien on my home. I would highly suggest exploring other clean-up options as there are other better, more professional options. I repeat, do not use this Roto-Rooter location unless you want to end up being taken advantage of and left with more misery than you started with.

Tony the plumber was not only efficient but extremely informative about the plumbing in my house. He answered every question i threw at him not only about roto-rooter products but about plumbing in general. For example, I had no idea how important good plumbing is to the health concerns of people in residences or office buildings. He pointed out how pipes that are well taken care of can prevent gas leaks from entering the home or the office. Overall, Tony's an outstanding plumber and valuable employee to the roto-rooter corporation.

The plumber came out within an hour of my call and was able to figure out the issue pretty quickly - a block in our main line to the septic. He did a great job, fixed the problem quickly. However, the cost was high for the amount of time that he was here and the work he did.

I woke up to find water and toilet paper (gross) on my front walkway.  We clearly had a back up that needed immediate attention and I called Roto-Rooter.  Within minutes, we had a representative on the telephone and assurances that someone was in the area and would be there within the hour.  Sure enough, the truck pulled in an hour later and immediately began working on our pipes to clear the horrifying clog that created the mess (literally) on the walkway.  The repair man stayed until I was sure that I could run the facets, flush the toilets and wash the clothes without any further mess!  Thanks for the professional work.  Highly recommended.

Called them on Sun 7/3/2011 due to a problem with my water heater.  The service tech arrived within a few hours and fixed it, checked a few extra things to make sure the water heater operated safely and gave me some tips for some other project in the house I am thinking about.  I would recommend them any time.

Two days ago (5-23-2011) I had a leak in my kitchen that was coming from the bathroom upstairs and needed a plumber ASAP! I went online and looked up local plumbers and found Roto-Rooter, I filled out a questioner to get a quote and within minutes I got a call from them to schedule an in home free consultation. Two hours later a service technician named Matt (#2542) came to the house and thoroughly explained what the problem was. Matt repaired the worn parts and made recommendations that would prevent future leakage. Roto-Rooters was reliable and provided exceptional service!

Had an urgent toilet back up at night and Matt, the plumber came and explained everything to me and was able to clear the clog.

Contacted Roto-Rooter for help with a clogged bathtub drain.  The response was immediate!  Vinny came to our home at exactly the promised time, assessed the situation accurately - I felt he was very honest regarding what needed to be done (as opposed to the last plummer we had, and completed the work quickly, neatly, and professionally.  I thought this type of old-fashioned, jprofessional service was a thing of the past, so we are very pleased.I would highly recommend Vinny and the Mamaroneck group to anyone.  I will call them for all of my plumbing needs in the future!

Simply a wonderful and caring office where I felt that I wasn't just another client or a retainer fee. My consultation was free and it wasn't over until all of my questions were answered fully and in a language that I could understand. Two attorneys worked on my case, Brian and Adam and both were very good and knew their stuff. Everything was worked out with my husband's attorney and needless to say I was more than satisfied with the results. They are expensive more than some other firms that I had consultations with but I was rushed in and out of the other consultations and did not have the same feeling that they really were concerned about me, just my money.

This is the best lawyer I've ever had. I always go to him with my problems and I have known him for over 15 years. He knows the law by heart and I recommend him to everybody.

Only found  this office after going online and reading reviews about Tanya on this site and on Avvo, another online lawyer listing site. I met with and subsequently retained Tanya to represent me because I wanted a woman lawyer to represent me because I have kids and thought that a woman would better understand me and my concerns in my divorce. Well I was right in my choice because I was very pleased with the agreement that my ex and I signed and the case only took a couple of months. had I known how the process worked I would not have waited so long to start the divorce and endured a bad marriage for as long as I did.

There are a lot of lawyers out there but with the Freemans I have found the lawyers for me. They are the best at municipal court cases.

Tanya is an outstanding lawyer whose litigation skills seem unreal for someone who hasn't has been a lawyer very long. To say that she was impressive in court would be an understatement. I was truly amazed and very satisfied with how my case was handled and customer service that I received. Tanya is truly a keeper.

Tanya and Brian were absolutely perfect in the way they worked my divorce case. I always felt like they were on top of their game and the results proved it!! Tanya was especially involved in filing the motions and meeting with me but they really took a joint approach in working the case together. Without a doubt I was totally satisfied with how my case was resolved even through it did cost a lot of money.

In these days it is not often that you can a find a lawyer who fights hard for you and really tells you what kind of case you have, good or bad . I found that level of professionalism at the Freeman law firm and I appreciated the service I got and how my case was handled from start to finish. The staff was on the ball and nice to deal with I felt like I had made the best choice in been represented by Brian and Tanya. I can recommend this office without reservation.

No question that BCF law office is on the one!! Did my case like a real pro and they got it dismissed. I  was in a serious situation with my driver's license on the line in North Bergen municipal court  and I needed a miracle, well thanks to kelvin Gill who went to court with me the judge tossed three out of the four tickets and I only pleaded guilty to a no point ticket with no surcharge!!!! That's what I call representation!!!!!!! thank you Kelvin and I will always recommend your office if someone I know has to go to court.

No one has helped so much as Brian did for me in my court case. He promised to do his best in my divorce and he was terrific!! I can relate to those people who feel that lawyers only care about money because that is how I felt about my first lawyer. I was depressed and about to give up hope and then I met Brian and everything changed for the better.  I recommend him now to everyone that I know who needs a lawyer.

Mr. Freeman did an exceptional job on my divorce case, he was on top of it from the moment I paid my retainer until the judge said i was divorced. The whole experience was  emotionally draining for me but his staff really treated me with respect and that feeling that they actually cared about me helped make a bad time a little better. There is no question that I recommend Mr. Freeman to anyone looking for a divorce lawyer, he was there for me and got me a great settlement. His office manager Deris was very professional and cute!!!!!!

Positives: knowledgeable, good customer service, effective and aggressive in the courtroom. Negatives, very, very expensive!   He represented me for my divorce and was able to deliver everything that he promised. I was kept informed as to all developments  in my case and he returned all of my calls within a day or two. The most important thing to me was that I felt comfortable with his representation from start to finish and his staff played a big role in that.

Mr. Mantell, you have come a long way for me and for that I want to thank you. At times during the hearing I feared we would not prevail but it was your persistence and determination that turned those fears away. I not only want to thank you for the check, but also because you proved in court that we were right. Now that this is behind us, I want to thank you again from deep in my heart. If we need legal support again in the future I hope you will be there for us.

I was once a distraught grad student who you helped out regarding my living situation with my roommates. Thank you for going out of your way from busy schedule to listen and offer your expert advise. You even went the distance by being compassionate and making sure I was okay (in terms of health and state of mind). This meant more than words can express. While most others would have laughed at me and turned the other way, you took my case and for that I m very thankful. I remember you stating that you had a daughter around my age. She is very blessed to have such a highly professional and respected father who is furthermore compassionate.

We retained Ross and Asmar when we needed a criminal defense attorney. The lawyer was able to get the charges dropped after an investigation proved that it was all a big mistake. He proved that there was no criminal intent, just two people who made a wrong choice which got them in trouble. It is all behind us now thanks to the excellent criminal defense lawyer from Ross and Asmar.

When I was injured by falling construction debris I hired Ross and Asmar as my civil attorney in New York and filed a law suit against the construction company and the building owners. My attorney was tenacious and fought relentlessly and won me the settlement I deserved for loss of work, pain and suffering. I would recommend to anyone who has been injured through the fault of another to retain Ross and Asmar for the best results.

I had a divorce attorney from Ross and Asmar and my divorce went better than I expected, I was pleased with my settlement and because it was a no fault we both walked away clean without a court fight. I would highly recommend seeing Ross and Asmar if you need a good divorce attorney.

When my husband filed for full custody of our children I had to fight back and fight hard. I did it with the help of a child custody attorney from Ross and Asmar. There was no way I was going to let my kids be taken from me. My child custody lawyer fought hard and we won. I and so fortunate to have had a child custody attorney that shared in my determination.

As soon as the ban on same s.ex marriage lifted my wife and I hired a New York same s.ex marriage immigration attorney. My wife was already facing deportation because the Feds did not recognize same s.ex marriage. As soon as possible our attorney from Ross and Asmar filed a same s.ex marriage petition and stopped the proceedings. For now we no longer have deportation to worry about.

I hired Ross and Asmar as my accident attorney in New York when I was involved in a crash with an emergency vehicle that did not slow down at an intersection. My accident attorney was very familiar with the New York guidelines pertaining to emergency response and proved that the EMS driver did not show proper caution. I won a settlement that was beyond what I had expected thanks to my New York accident lawyer.

Ross and Asmar came to me highly recommended and I can see why they were. As my defense attorney my lawyer was thorough in investigating my case and got the charges thrown out before it even went to trial. Now it is my turn to recommend New York defense lawyers Ross and Asmar.

I was glad to have an aggressive law firm on my side when I needed a New York divorce attorney. Ross and Asmar handled my case and got me the settlement I deserved. I would highly recommend them.

When we were in desperate need of a deportation attorney for my Uncle who is Polish, what were the chances that we found a polish attorney in Brooklyn to represent him? He did not understand English well and that was part of the reason he got caught up in this immigration mess. The attorney was able to sort everything out and go to the immigration service with the documentation they needed. Everything is OK today thanks to the immigration lawyer from Ross and Asmar.

We retained the services of Ross and Asmar as our same s.ex marriage petition attorney. Thanks to this wonderful law firm we are staying together in the US. Without filing the petition I would have been sent back to Ireland and my husband would have had to move there or fly back and forth. Either way it would have adversely affected our lives. Thank you so much Ross and Asmar.

I'm filling lucky because I found  this  office  3 years  ago.   I'm  UBER/LIFT   driver   and   I'm  driving   A LOT,    7days  a week.   Unfortunately,  some   times  we  getting   traffic   tickets,  too.    "Cops  don't  sleep "  !   My first  lawyer was  Evans  Fidelman,  great  professional,  with  great  mood  and  very  good  person.  He dismissed  all my 6 tickets  !  All 6 !  And  those  tickets  were   not   "one - episode",     they   were   given  me  all different  times .  This   guy  is  SUPPER  !   All my  friends  know   him .    He   is   "our  big   hope".     But , later,  I   asked  him  and  his  office   to  help  me   with   tickets  in  other  borough  of  NYC.   And   same  success   for   me!  2 from  2 !    That's   why   I'm   filling  lucky  !    THANK  YOU for  all  Your  efforts  !  God bless You  !  RAUL KOPALEISHVILI.

Jeffery Lichtman was most helpful to me when I sued my surgeon due to what I considered negligence on her part. Trolman, Glaser & Lichtman was helpful, understanding, knowledgeable, timely, ethical and honest. While I would have preferred to go to trial, he was right to have me settle out of court. I was very pleased with the outcome and would use Jeff and his office again for future representation.

Trolman, Glaser &amp; Lichtman, PC was my personal injury law firm a few years ago when I was involved in a motor vehicle accident. I was rear-ended by another driver and I sustained multiple injuries. Jeff alleviated my anxiety and made sure I received the proper medical treatment. He is knowledgeable, efficient and caring and always in his clients corner. I would highly recommend TGL to anyone looking for a qualified attorney who gets down to business, is proficient in his field, and enjoys helping his clients.

In 2008 I had a serious car accident that left me in much pain and suffering. A friend of my husband's introduced me to a high shot lawyer in NYC. I gave him my case and that was the last time I heard from him. Each time I called him pertaining to my case and left a message he did not return my phone calls and two years pasted with no response. I became quite frustrated and a friend of mine who had used your firm in the past told me about Trolman, Glaser &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Lichtman, and PC and after one phone call we had a meeting and I felt very comfortable with you handling my case. I trusted you and your staff and was confident that I would have quality representation and in less than one year after you took my case, it was resolved for a figure well beyond my imagination.I want to say special thanks for being the kind of attorneys you are with your go get them and solve attitude. You are very aggressive and returned all of my phone calls. I feel privileged to have you as my lawyer, helping me win my case. You convinced me not to settle my case and to try my case and your advice was excellent. Be assured that I will not delay in telling others why Trolman, Glaser &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Lichtman, should be contacted. If anybody has been looking for an aggressive and exceptionally good lawyer that they can feel comfortable with, you are the one to contact. You gave me exceptional good value and this thank you is for you. It was a pleasure doing business with you.Thank you for being my lawyer and now friend. The loss of my child and the guiding star of my life made me lose faith in all. You were always there for me and I appreciate your friendship. You have made the unbearable bearable and showed me how hope, love and faith can conquer the darkest days.

I endorse and thank Trolman, Glaser &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Lichtman, and PC for taking care of my elderly mother and family during a difficult time.  My mother sustained life threatening injuries and permanent disabilities as a result of a serious accident with a large truck. She was helicoptered to a hospital in critical condition and we had limited knowledge of the legal system and her rights. She required extensive medical care and will require much care and support for the balance of her life. Mr. Lichtman and his staff were available to us 24/7 and he worried about my mother like he was her son. We consider him a new member of our family and he achieved a result well beyond our expectations and I know that mom and the rest of my family will not have to worry about her financial and medical needs for the remainder of her life. Even when the case was finished he remains committed to our family's well being. Thank goodness that there are lawyers like this who care. I also want to thank his assistants for their concerns, support, honesty, patience, and follow up. I know that sometimes I was a difficult and demanding client, but you were always polite and responsive and nothing was too much to ask. I recommend this firm to anyone who wants an honest, committed, responsive and passionate lawyer.

Excellent Landlord Tenant Lawyers who dominated in Court.

I own one building. Whenever a tenant is behind on rent I use this firm to sue in Landlord Tenant Court for my back rent and they always get it for me very quick. They are better and they charge much less than the other law firms. I have been very pleased with them. I did not know how good they are until recently. I also have a business that has not been doing well lately. I owed the my landlord over $20000.00 in back rent that I did not have. My landlord sued me and I thought I would lose my business. I thought that since my tenants always paid the rent quick or faced eviction that the same would happen to me. I did not know how excellent these attorneys were. They got me a 6 month payout to catch up on the back rent. I paid all the rent. My business was saved and I owe it all to Mark Cohen and Robert Rosenblatt for their excellent legal representation!‎

The first time I was sued in a non-payment proceeding in landlord tenant Court was in 2009.  I went to Court and I was fooled by the landlord's attorney to sign an agreement that was not in my best interests.  In 2010, I was sued by the landlord again.  This time I knew not to make the same mistake again.  For a few hundred dollars, this firm represented me and got me an amazing deal.  First they stalled the case many months giving me time to raise the rent. When I had the rent saved up, they got my repairs done.  After the repairs were done, they got me a rent reduction based upon the violations in my apartment.   They are the best!

I was being sued by my landlord.   I did not have a lawyer.  The landlord's lawyer was trying to intimidate me into signing an agreement to move from my apartment within a month.  While I was in Court,  I was watching the way the attorneys from this firm handled their case so aggressively.  They were really having arguments with other lawyers when they were fighting for their clients rights.  I asked for their card.   Three days later, I went to their office and I hired them.  They looked at the papers I was served with and they saw defects in the papers.   They took the case before the Judge and the Court dismissed the case because the landlord's attorney did not prepare the papers properly.  They were THE BEST!
 -

 - 
Originally, I had another law firm representing me. I met one of the lawyers in Court. He seemed very aggressive and it was obvious when he went in front of the Judge that he commanded respect. I asked for their card and that afternoon I switched lawyers. This firm took the case to Trial. There was a defect in the landlord's papers that my other lawyer did not even pick up. The case was dismissed after Trial. The landlord had to start another case and by the time the 2nd case went to Trial, my daughter and I found a new apartment and I moved. They were the best!! Hopefully I will not need them any time soon!‎

Whether you are a landlord or a tenant, you will never find a law firm with such vast experience in Landlord Tenant Court.  They live in the Court.  They have cases in every Court in New York City every day.  They are superior in representing tenants rights because they know virtually every trick in the book.  If you use them once, you will recommend them to your friends.   THATS HOW GOOD THEY ARE!!   You can reach Robert Rosenblatt, Esq 24/7 on his cell phone917-838-1220.  Its great to know that whenever I need him, he is just a phone call away.    The other attorneys at this firm are as excellent as Robert.   They are great and I highly recommend them to you!

TENANTS RIGHTS, LANDLORD RIGHTS, Non Payments, Holdovers, Orders to Show cause.  They appear in every Borough of the City of New York every day for over 25 years.  They will charge you much less than the other firms and they will do a better job for you.  I gave them a test try with one of my cases and now they have the entire account because they fought so hard for my rights. I was very pleased with them.   The fact that I could reach Robert Rosenblatt, Esq. on his cell phone 917-838-1220 at any time of the day or night made me realize that they are the best lawyers for me!

Have you ever gone into a restaurant that did not have that elegant look, but when you ate the food, you realized that this is some of the best food you ever ate?That is the correlation that I make with this law firm.   Their office is not the most impressive office you will see, but they will charge you a very reasonable fee and then they will fight for your rights like you are their biggest client.Their consultation was free.  The legal services I received  was exceptional.  They most zealously represented my rights.  They fought for my rights and they got me an excellent settlement.  I would highly recommend this firm.

When we received our Notice of Intent to Deny for our AWA waiver request, my heart sank.  All I could think was my family would be split apart based upon a stupid mistake I made years ago.  I searched the internet and called a bunch of immigration attorneys, most did not even hear of Adam Walsh Act.  Eventually I came upon some articles Nicklaus wrote about it.  We contacted him and wow his experience really paid off!!!

We need more than 5  stars to rate !Nick really knows what he doing , all what he says went exactly , He win our case from the office in very short time , we appreciated his advice's to start early to get the status early .     For sure we recommend this firm .

Can't say enough good things about Nicklaus.  We thought we were finished and could no longer trust lawyers.  Nicklaus represented us in court and won our waiver case.  We cried for hours when we received the decision.  All I can say is hire them!

I have had nothing but wonderful experiences with Mr. Kishner. He has helped my family acquire our first business lease as well as guided us through all necessary negotiations. We were also able to purchase our first home in queens while selling our apartment in manhattan. His service is top notch and I love the fact that I can call upon him as needed and he makes time for me.

Top notch service. I am so pleased that I recently closed on my coop with Bryan Kishner and his associates. Bryan, his associates and all his staff are extremely professional, quick to respond to my calls and emails and put my mind at ease when dealing with the emotional side of selling my home. Bryan represented me years ago when I purchased my home and am very happy to have chosen him again. I highly recommend Bryan when you are selling or buying a home.

Bryan Kishner was recommended to me through a friend.  I recently bought a coop and with delays due to inspections, etc., we were lucky enough to have Bryan who knew the system inside and out and was able to make the process as smooth and quick as possible under the circumstances.  He answered almost every call we made throughout the process and if he didn't, he returned the call quickly.  I would not hesitate to recommend his services to anybody.

We recently almost bought a coop, bought a coop, fired a negligent contractor and sold our previous coop with the help of Bryan W. Kishner. Working with Bryan was UNEQUIVOCALLY THE BEST part of this somewhat torturous process. Despite my not being the easiest client, Bryan remained PATIENT and in his FRIENDLY and CALM manner explained the relevant issues in a remarkably clear manner. His MASTERY of the law was comprehensive and his application of the law was ETHICAL. While dealing with brokers etc who did not always have our best interests at heart, I know Bryan ADVOCATED FOR MY FAMILY fully.I have complete confidence in his legal knowledge, his moral behavior and his commitment to his clients. The only part of the 'Manhattan real estate scene' that I will miss, is him!I recommend Bryan W. Kishner and his staff without reservation.

Bryan Kishner fights for his clients. He is extremely knowledgable and reasonable. He is dedicated and makes sure that he is on your side, as all lawyers who know their business should do.... I find it hard to believe he would charge anybody $5000 for a closing, other review seems rather suspicious. I have used his services twice already and I have and will continue to recommend him to my friends.

Richard Southard, is amazing, words cannot describe how grateful I am for choosing him as my lawyer. When I first called Mr.Southard and explained my case he knew exactly what i was charged with and assured me that everything was going to be alright. Which was something that i was looking for in a lawyer, I knew when i made the right decision when I went into his office  with a welcoming smile and then he had shown me proof of my charges. Again, he had shown me his confidence so well that, he knew he was going to beat this case and get my charged drop. During my court date, I wasn't even in court for no longer than 30 mins and the DA offered me an ACD which was what Mr.Southard and I agreed on. My case is now dismissed and sealed, I couldn't Thank Richard Southard enough. He was very affordable, informing and caring, which was everything I could ask for. I am sure that I wont get into trouble ever again but if I or any other of my loved ones are in a sticky situation, he will be the first person to call.

This guy definitely knows what he's doing. I've got myself into a lot of trouble when I was young and didn't realize all the dangers of drinking and driving when I was so drunk that I drove on the wrong side of the road, only stopping when I met the police car bumper to bumper coming straight at me. To make things worse, I blew a crazy .26 into the breathalize. Moreover, the cops tried to press criminal charges against me for almost smashing into them. I was looking to get at least a felony DWI charge, which would put a cross to my dream of becoming a physician. I'm still not sure how, but Mr. Southard was able to work his magic and got my felony charges reduced to a traffic violation! Would recommed him to anybody in need of legal assistance and he has already helped many of my friends.

I would not be alive today if I was not for the hard work and dedication of Richard Southard.  Rich is single focus from the day he took on my case was to get me the deal that I wanted.  And he NEVER did anything without that goal in mind.  I was in an impossible situation and thanks to Rich Southard I avoided what could have been a very dark period in my life.  Rich is warm, personable, patient and understands what it takes in front of the judge and "behind the scenes".  When you are in trouble and your life is about to take a turn for the worse there are several decisions you must make.  The one choice you can not get wrong is hiring a true professional defense lawyer.  Richard Southard is the best choice you can make.  Why roll the dice with a young kid or a snake oil sales person?  Hire a winner who will get you the best result possible.  I owe my future to him.

I was slightly bewildered when trying to choose an attorney and unsure of which to choose out of the countless that work in Manhattan.  I felt very assured after my initial consultation and I wasn't let down.  I was kept well informed at all times and the matter was dealt with swiftly and effectively.  If I need another criminal lawyer at some point then I will use LORS again.

I am extremely pleased with Richard's professional skills and knowledge or law. If it weren't for him I would be in a very unpleasant financial situation.Richard went all out of his way to help me win DWI case I was charged with. He never stopped (almost 2 years), even in situations when I frankly thought that this case is completely hopeless. He got all of the charges dismissed and I have a fresh start because of him.I hope that there are more attorneys like Richard Southard!!!Victor N.

I stumbled upon Richard Southard by sheer accident. I dialed the wrong number and I got the RIGHT Lawyer for my problem. He got my case dismissed and I even counter sued and won! His hard work and determination are a wonderful asset. He is reliable trustworthy and dependable I would use him again with out a doubt. His AAA+ expertise is highly recommended. This man is a saint!

I was in an accident and I hired Mr. Kenneth A. Wilhelm to represent me.  I received excellent service and care, and within six months, I got a surprising settlement. I can't say enough about Mr. Wilhelm, and I have already recommended his firm to all my friends and family.

My mother knew Mr. Wilhelm many years ago when she worked in the claims department of the NYC Transit Authority in Brooklyn. She had the greatest regard & respect for him and his work.  Just recently, the Wilhelm firm won a case for my granddaughter concerning a dog bite on her face, and she received a wonderful settlement!  I am very thankful to Mr. Wilhelm, and I wish him a happy and healthy 2012.

I once had two beautiful daughters, but after the accident, the eldest is no longer in this world, and the younger one is living, but is mentally handicapped. Once bright and beautiful, she is no longer able to do anything by her own means. It is heartbreaking!  Nothing could bring back the past or make up for what was done; however, I am grateful for the Law Offices of Kenneth A. Wilhelm and all their efforts in recovering what could be recovered and making that possible.  My lawyer listened to what I had to say, and I could tell that he was putting his heart into my case.  He told me not to worry and that they would take the matter into their hands. For five long years, the firm processed my case with incredible work, effort and determination.  They did everything that could possibly be done for me.  They understood the circumstances of my case, and I was able to fully trust their expertise and feel at ease handing over such a delicate, but serious issue to real professionals.  No one should have to go through the kind of trauma I went through. God forbid such a tragedy were to happen to anyone else, I strongly and deliberately recommend the Law Offices of Kenneth A. Wilhelm to secure the same kind of immediate consultation and wholehearted services that were invested into my own case.

This is a long overdue thank you.  I just wanted to thank you and your entire staff for the work you did and how you handled the airline company on behalf of my son and me.  When we first met, you said you wanted to provide security for my son's future, and I certainly feel that you and your firm have done that. My son is twelve years old now, and he is looking forward to attending college in a few years without any financial worries.  Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

Bruce did a magnificent job for me. I initially signed up for the second opinion only, but case progress spelled a change of counsel, which I fortunately did.

Simple uncontested divorce - not much to be said. Effective and adequately priced service.
 -

We had a decade-long child custody and child support litigation that I thought would outlive me. Bruce was quick to find the loophole that was later exploited. I regained much of the missing rights. This is the lawyer who really serves the justice.
 -

Very good looking attorney, but also a "good acting" one which is far more important. Got me out of the divorce turmoil gracefully. I retained much of my property and also established visitation rights for my kids. Great work done.
 -

I had a few minor issues with my ongoing divorce settlement, but Bruce was able to negotiate. I am not too easy to deal with, but still he could storm through the case and convice me to take the best possible route.

Thank you so much, Mr. Provda. I was in the middle of a painful custody battle with my ex-spouse. Within half an hour of talking to Bruce, I was well convinced he was the lawyer I needed to win my case. The best part of it was the fact Bruce was actually interested in helping me. All the other attorneys I know care about only one thing: MONEY. After 6 months of ebb and flow from the counter-party they decided to withdraw all claims. Once again, I am very thankful to entire provda law team. Should someone I know face a divorce or a family matter, I will show them the way.

Yes , indeed - top star rating ( ***** ) Ms. Morghan Richardson , Esq . and Paul R , Esq. helped me in an extremely difficult and distressful situation ( where other lawyers simply failed , while charging much larger fees )   ; Ms. Morghan and Paul are professional and expeditious ;  yet ,  generous with their time allocated to my case ; MOST IMPORTANT TO ME - Ms. Morghan  and Paul response to my concerns was very sensitive / " human touch " ; thanks , I will highly recommend them to my friends .Michael A.

I was very pleased with Richardson Legal. They actually show genuine concern about their clients and not just taking your money. I had gone to a lawyer previously regarding my divorce for legal consultation. It felt cold, they were difficult to reach and seemed as thought they were more concerned about my money rather than me and my family. I had the complete opposite experience at Richardson Legal! I have already recommended them to my friends.

Mrs Morghan Ricardson repesented me in my divcorce proceeding and family court. She is a GREAT lawyer and she is a very caring person. Morghan answered all my questions and never failed to promptly return calls or emails. She always made time to see me and was always on time for court proceeding. She is a very seasoned lawyer and very truthful. Morghan has been a great counselor to me. She helped me... read more get my life back.I never once feared for anything concerning my divorce because she was always right. She is a very caring person and she goes out of her way to make clients like me steady. I have in the past recommended clients to her they to were happy with her service. Divorce is not an easy situation and very stressful but Morghan created and enviroment that was stress free. She is a very professional person and always on time for court dates. This lawyer has earned my five star and I highly recommend her. She is worth it

Morghan is not only an extremely competent and experienced attorney, she is also a sensitive person who walked me through an unusual and complicated separation and divorce. She was tough and aggressive when appropriate, yet professional throughout. The result was a divorce that I feel is in both parties' best interest, and completed in a dignified manner.

Ms Richardson helped me with questions regarding child support and tax returns. Her treatment of my query was prompt, helpful and professional. She did a great job of getting to the heart of the matter, and was able to provide me with a succinct explanation from a legal perspective.

Attorneys who fight for my rights.    My lease expired and the landlord tried to evict me on a Holdover proceeding.   I wanted my kids to finish the school year before switching schools, but the landlords attorney was only willing to give me 2 months to move when I got to Court.  I asked the Judge for an adjournment to hire a lawyer.  I checked out the reviews of this firm and I went to see them.  I was impressed with what I saw so I hired them.   They got me 8 months and my children were able to finish out the school year before we moved.   I am extremely grateful for their hard work

The law offices of Martin A Kron helped resolve a huge mess of commercial trucking tickets we incurred in New York.  Since we live in Florida, showing up to court with our busy schedule was out of the question for us.  We didn't know where to begin and after talking to Mr. Kron's office, we were assured that they would definitely be able to help us, while other offices were not willing to take our case.  From start to finish the process was well communicated, professionally handled, and provided excellent customer service if we ever had any questions or concerns.  We would definitely recommend this office and are very grateful for their services!

Larry Moy represented me in a separation agreement with my employer in the banking sector.  I couldn’t have been happier with the process and the result. Larry’s 37+ years’ experience in this field were clear; he helped me to negotiate a far better result than I would have achieved otherwise.  Moreover, Larry was kind, pragmatic, and extremely responsive every step of the way.

I was injured while working as a police officer on a motorcycle detail. Salvatore Marabondo is my attorney, and he did a fantastic job for me. After a trial I received a very good award. I wish I hadn't been hurt, but I am so very glad that I had Sal Marabondo represent me.

When my Moma got hurt at the train station, Mister Sal Marabondo represented her, and got her nearly a half million dollars, which she really deserved.  He was very kind to her, and to my Dad.  He has a beautiful office with a very professional staff.  Mostly, he is just a realy good lawyer.L.E.

I work for a doctor, and I had known Sal Marabondo for about 15 years because of my job.  When we had our accident, I could have gone to many different lawyers.  I was aware of some of the good results that Mr. Marabondo had gotten for the doctor's patients over the years, so I asked Sal Marabondo to represent me.  I made the best decision!  I had no idea how throuough he is, and how comfortable he would make this whole process for me.  He always returned my phone calls, he knew the laws that concerned my case, and he got me a very good settlement.  I would recommend him to anyone who wants the best legal advice, and wants to trust their lawyer.Cathy B.

Mr. Sal Marabondo did a wonderful for my husband and I.  He made us feel comfortable, and prepared us for every step in the process.

We appreciate his honesty with us, and his hard work!  God Bless him.Melissa S.

I am a woman from the Caribbean Island and even though I have been living here for a number of years, I have had very little interaction with the court systems and litigation. A person who is from the same Islands, married me a decade and half ago, and we have a child. After many years into the marriage, I was not even aware he went ahead and filed for divorce. Over the years, he has accumulated a lot of savings in pension plans and retirement funds and he is quite smart in understanding how the legal systems work. I was not aware of any of his assets; one day, he filed for a divorce and then pretended as if nothing happened. He never served on me directly, but, was devising a way to fool me by not serving but going ahead and obtaining a default order, with no disclosure and no distribution to me. I was naive but something in my mind was telling me something was not alright, because, my neighbors told me somebody like a process server came to my home in my absence. I went and checked the Court and to my horror I found out my husband filed a divorce action against me more than a year ago; this is the time, when I somehow came into contact Mr. Viswanathan's Office and his Office did a brilliant job in bringing into light everything that happened right on my back and explained everything to me. My Law Office immediately moved the Court and in detail put forth in the papers before the Court everything that happened. Now, my case proceeding very well far beyond my expectations. I shall be entitled to a share in his assets; further, I am going to be entitled to a good spousal support and a child support. I did not even imagine that I would be entitled to a penny from my husband. All because of the great investigative legal work carried out by Mr. Viswanathan and his excellent team. I am now so happy because of their great work. My husband whom I meet every week, is sulking and the nature of his talk completely changed - for the better

My experience with the Akin Law Group, especially Mr. Zafer Akin has been phenomenal. Far too often, people are not eager to write reviews, but I wanted to take the time to write to let you know that I am very pleased with the incredible mix of patience and intelligence, performance, support, professionalism and determination of Mr. Akin. Throughout my case, he and his assistants were always very quick to respond, made themselves available during times that most would consider after hours and always patient in explaining the status and details/developments of my case. His answers to our questions are always clear, complete, and demonstrate a sophisticated knowledge of the case and the intricacies involved. That is just what people need in stressful situations.And it's no mystery why he has many attorney awards, plaques, and trophies.I highly recommend the Akin Law Group.

My dogs are properly trimmed and bathed and are in good spirits when I go to pick them up. Chuck has a customer for as long as he's in business!

We have taken our dog to nyc pet services for almost a year now. I checked all over Astoria until I found Sam and her team and can't thank them enough for what they have done for our boy. We just picked our boy up today after a 2 week stay. Happy to say he came home very healthy, happy & smelling good ! We also got frequent  updates via email and phone. We had a great vacation because we didn't worry about our baby!

Cannot imagine a better place to drop off the dog you love. Friendliest dog-lovers on duty there. The facility always smells so clean and nice. And they have a perfect view of where your dogs are playing so nothing is hidden or out of sight which gives me extra piece of mind I love that they have an interview / intake process for all dogs, because this assures me that all other dogs have been tested for behavioral issues and are up to date on their vaccines. They are very detail oriented and also accommodating for dogs with special needs. As mine is on very specific medication that he needs to take daily at an exact hour. Whats better is they don't charge extra for this service, like other places. They also walk my boy according to his schedule and I'm sure of this as I work in the area and have seen them out with my boy.I Cannot rave enough about that place. I always get back a very happy dog, which is what matters most. Max is a loyal customer as am I !

Our dog has went to several dog daycares in Astoria, and this was by far the best! Our dog was always so happy to go play at nyc pet services. I HIGHLY recommend this place being that my dog has anxiety and they took extra measures which meant alot to me. As mentioned I took him to another daycare and he HATED going (shaking on the way there, trying to escape, whining, etc.). I felt so bad dropping him off when I went to work, so I decided to try nycps. The staff knew him by name after only 1 day of daycare and they gave me progress updates on his separation anxiety. Since than hes such a happier dog !

NYC Pet Services is truly a life saver!! Noodle used to suffer from separation anxiety before we started bringing her here. Once I started taking her to daycare a few times a week she slowly began to show huge improvement, to the point where we were even able to leave her overnight. She even started pulling me towards the door once with hit the corner, telling me she really loves this place and so do we ! Thank you to everyone at NYCPS for taking such good care of our Noodle and putting us at ease while at work.

My wife and I absolutely love nyc pet services. We have been using them for almost 3 years now and cannot recommend them to everyone enough! Samantha and her staff are loving, caring, and sincerely care about our little boy, George. We can tell by how happy he gets when we are approaching the shop, he literally runs inside. We often use nycps for overnight sleepovers and daily walking. Knowing we have them to watch and look after our George, gives us an extreme peace of mind. They are always there ready send us updates with pictures ANYTIME we ask--and I mean ANYTIME. I once texted the overnight person at 11:30 at night, as I was out of the country and the time zones were very different, and right away I received a video of Georgie getting ready to sleep. We also use their dog walking services 4x times a week with some last minute walks here and there. After every walk, we receive a text letting us know how the walk went. These are just some little details, that go along way; showing us just how much they care for George and that he is safe in their hands. I would recommend NYCPS to anyone wanting a caring and safe boarding/walking facility. Thank you guys for everything you do !

They are absolutely fantastic!! Great staff and our Molly loved it. They had us come in for an introduction with Molly before we left her for her first daycare visit. They we super sweet and couldn't have been more comforting. We live about 20 away but chose NYCPS because of the excellent reviews we had read. When I went to pick up Molly she didn't want to leave, which is a really good sign in my eyes.Thank you for making us feel so comfortable with leaving our girl with you. If my dog Molly is happy then we are. Thank you for everything guys, would definitely recommend to everyone I know.

My cat memo was acting all types of insane when I brought him to get his nails cut & ears cleaned, but the two women who took care of him were so patient & friendly! I felt so bad that my cat was acting up & making a mess but they made me feel at ease & still took care of my cat the way I hoped they would! Love this place, the whole atmosphere made me feel like they are really passionate about animals & taking good care of them.  definitely only bringing him here from now on! Thanks again !

I took my 3 year old Maltese on Valentine's Day to the The Dog 'N Cat House. His "Groomer Alton" did an amazing job. The owner & staff were professional & friendly and made my dog feel right at home.  The dogs that were being groomed that day all looked amazing. My Maltese was not nervous at all.  If your looking for a place in Queens, I highly recommend The Dog "N Cat House.

From the moment I came in I felt at ease.  Yes, I had visited quite a few other groomers.  After all it is our first puppy...and our first puppy's hair cut.  I trusted them and they did a great job.  Harley seemed to be at ease when I left.I would recommend you take your pets to the Dog N Cat House....everyone there seems to love what they are doing!!!(Yes, the place was spotless)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Highly personable and professional staff. They are friendly and  accommodating, patiently answer questions on the services offered. The owner, Mauracio is a veterinarian  and has created an exceptional business model combining grooming and kennel services under one roof and they even cut nails!(i learned later that most groomers do  but Mauricio seemed to have a deft hand and soothing voice and my dog was very calm during the whole procedure.)Walk-ins are encouraged and prices for all services are competítive for Hudson county.I

I've been to a couple of groomers and was never really satisfied with how they groomed Teddy.  I wasn't sure what to expect when I made the appt.  I would recommend pawfection to everyone who has a dog and wants excellent, professional and most of all caring service.  Mary definitely loves what she does and is extremely gentle!  Thanks for an excellent job. Definitely a groomer for life!!!!!

Wonderful experiance, expert grooming, and just an all around great place. She even gave me a 20% discount because I just adopted my pet from the shelter. The sheler told me she always grooms shelter pets for free because she really wants them to have a better chance at finding a forever home. The shleter I got him from reffered her but I had no idea I would get such a great discount. She even gave him a toy. You can tell she really cares and loves her job. I've delt with quite a few groomers around here, thank god for some new choices. I hated traveling so far for someone decent.

In all my dogs 12 years, this has been the first time I've been happy with my dogs hair cut. She was so pleasant, and when I picked up Hershey she had nothing but good things to say. The price was very reasonable. She let him hang out around the shop too, not just caging him for hours like the last place I went. You could honestly tell she cared.

Finally some new blood. Very sweet compassionate groomer. She hand dried my dog for over an hour to make sure Valentine was completely dry. I don't think she uses cage driers. She greeted him with such enthusiasm he instantly loved her. Her shop is gorgeous! On the caliber with Hoboken and NY shops. Yet her prices was cheaper then these local run down looking shops. Great Place, Great Grooming services!!

Trust me, my toy poodle looked like a movie star ready for Hollywood or the show ring when I picked her up after she was groomed.  I had to leave my sun glasses on as she glowed, glittered and sparkled so much from her excellent grooming!   I had tried the other two groomers in the neighborhood a number of times before being "guided" to Rocco and Jezebel.  Most important was the groomer's extra extra work in cleaning my dog's ears that these other groomers had apparently not bothered with much.  I nearly cried when I saw the humongus amount of debris that had been left by them.  My dog was saved from serious ear infection.  Thank God for Andrea!  Also when I asked for clean paws I got really clean paws vs having over an eighth of an inch of fur left on paws by the other two groomers (perhaps so I would have to return sooner for grooming?)  She had time to talk to me vs just robotically usher me out when I had questions.  Also she tailored and priced her services according to what was actually needed and not needed which I gratefully appreciated. I'm a customer for life!

Andrea is a wealth of knowledge and she genuinely loves the pets she cares for.  I can't believe there's so much heart in such a small store.   They seem to remember everyone's name, and more importantly every pet's name.

Rocco and Jezebel is like a home away from home for my 4-year-old rescue greyhound (and for me - I think we're both equally excited anytime we get a chance to stop by). This deceivingly petite shop offers the gamut of services, from comprehensive grooming to a big air-conditioned kennel for boarding, plus dog walking and home cat sitting. The products are upscale and hand-picked by the owner, Andrea, with an emphasis on holistic and organic foods and chemical-free pet-health products. She has an awesome selection of collars and leashes and the cutest dog apparel you can imagine, plus all kinds of yummy treats and groovy toys. Hands down the best thing about this shop, though, is the welcoming, friendly atmosphere and personal attention that Andrea and her staff give each and every customer. It's a delightful place to spend time. I can also vouch for Rocco and Jezebel's dog-walking services: Andrea personally walks my dog three to four times a week and she has been instrumental -- no, essential -- in facilitating his adjustment to life here in Brooklyn after spending the first 3 1/2 years of his life on a Florida dog track. This woman understands and adores animals and it shows. Rocco and Jezebel epitomizes everything that's good about small local businesses. You can really feel good about spending your money here, and your pets will benefit too. I wholeheartedly recommend it.

although everyone seems to have had either a bad  or semi bad experience i thought i would give them a try anyway. When I called i was sent to voice mail but that's understandable because they are an on the go company, i received a call back 20 min later. I made an appointment for 9/18/2014 at 10 am which was perfect for me. They arrived on time, the young man was extremely friendly and my daisy loved him. He took about an hour with her and i must say the job was amazing!!!! my little Pomeranian has never looked better :) the price was reasonable too $65.00 for a wash,cut, nail trim and ear cleaning :) plus they parked right in front of my door so i was able to keep an eye on the van. I would highly recommend this pet grooming company and they can look forward to getting another call from me as soon as daisy needs another cut :) pros: door to door service, great price, extremely nice, amazing jobcons: absolutely none ^_^

This grooming service was wonderful.  It was so convenient for me and wasn't at all stressful for my dog.  He didn't have to be away from me at the groomers for a day since this is a mobile service. The groomer was extremely professional and my dog looked great after he was done.  The price was very reasonable.  I will be recommending this service to everyone I know.

I was skeptical with trying a mobile service, but ended up being very impressed.  The van was extremely clean, the grooming was much better than my previous (non-mobile) groom shop, and my dog did not have to wait all day in a cage to be groomed. Based on my recommendation, 3 people on my street are also now using him and love it.  You can't beat the convenience of having your dog professional groomed right outside your front door!

I am new to the area, and was having trouble finding good and honest reviews of dog groomers. I took a chances on Tommy's and it worked out great for me and my dog!

Maria is the absolute best!I don't have enough money to have my two dogs, Cody and Rory, groomed regularly but Maria is never concerned. When they first see her, they immediately recognize her and then run away. Then they submit to being bathed and groomed, including the cutting of their nails, with no complaints whatsoever. I have heard stories about other dog groomers where they traumatized dogs and then the dogs were freaked out every time anyone came near them with a scissors or the like. Maria commands control but accompanied by total trust and submission and a magnificant product. My dogs love Maria and I do as well. Additionally, if I am not home, I leave her the keys to my apartment and trust her to the fullest extent. I adore my dogs and hope that Maria will groom them forever.

My dog, Prince, a shih-tsu, didn't like going to the groomer but when I called Good Dog! I found a groomer who comes to my home and treats my dog great!  The whole thing took only an hour and a half and there was very little mess.  She cleaned up too!When Prince was done getting groomed, his tail was wagging and he wanted his new groomer to stay and play. The groom was beautiful and my dog was happy.

I just have to say my first visit to snip-n-clip. was amazing. Kevin the owner and Cianna the helper were great with my dogs, I have a shepard with hip dysphlagia and he treated her so carefully that she came out beautiful and my yorkie came out looking like a movie star. I would highly recommend this dog groomer to any one and will be absolutely returning back again.licet ..pet owner

I started looking for a new groomer after my dogs last one cut him over a good portion of his neck.  Tiny Tails has not only taken the time to understand and talk to my in my now nervous state, they take such wonderful care of my dog. The first few times I went there, my dog was so scared to be groomed again and they were so patient. They did the grooming in parts to help my dog get over his traumatic experience. He has been going there a few months and he now runs to the door to get into the store. They made my life easier and my baby happy!

I had two dogs that I loved and was heartbroken when they both became terminally sick. Dr. Hana did everything possible to prolong their lives for few years, without any expensive and unesessary testing. He was very compassionate and always available to ease my pets pain and any concerns I might had. I will for ever be grateful for how he helped me in dealing and taking care of my beloved pets, and when the time came to let them go, he was so gentle and made me feel at ease in the most difficult time...I would recommend Dr. Hanna  and his equally great assistant Kris as well as the ladies in the reception to any pet lover in need of care for their pet. They are all the nicer team of profecionals one could wish for. I'm happy to share with you that I received a new puppy as a gift and he is already under the loving care of Dr. Hanna.

We'd like to thank Dr. Hanna and his staff for your kindness professionalism and your dedication to your career and your patients.

Your caring support was greatly appreciated it made our losses easier knowing you did all possible to truly care for them. We are for ever grateful to you all. May God Bless you and all that you do. We received your sympathy  card yesterday and it REALY meant a lot to our family and made this difficult time in our lives more bearable. We are searching to rescue another dog to help us heal our broken hearts, and we will have him/her under your great care since day one. I wish that all pets owners have conscientious vet as you are to care for their beloved pets. YOU ARE All WONDERFUL !! THE BEST VET TEAM I have experienced in caring for my dogs for over 30 years.

We had a few recommendations for a realtor to sell my mom's house in Prospect Heights. We settled on Ideal Properties and are extremely happy with our decision. Our brokers, James and Erik, were professional and experienced.

Our experience with Ideal could not have been any more ideal. Thank you!!

My first home purchase was a great experience thanks to Ideal's professional service throughout the process. My broker, and his team were very knowledgeable and were always willing to listen and help with any concerns I had, since this was all new to me.

My partner and I looked at over 20 apartments and talked to 5 different Brooklyn brokerages when we finally got a recommendation from a friend and got connected to Lorraine from Ideal. Lorraine is an amazing person, and spent so much of her time with us, mostly calming us down, or providing massive amounts of information on how to secure the right apartment for us in Brooklyn. Lorraine is an amazing broker, and a great individual we feel were lucky to have met.

My experience with Ideal was amazing. Joshua is an incredibly helpful, professional broker who made my rental process smooth and free of glitches. I was very nervous, as I am a young professional, moving to Brooklyn for the first time with very little knowledge of the area, the neighborhoods, the rental process. Josh found me a great place on a quiet block in Park Slope, with and access to everything I had specified I needed. Josh was always just a phone call away, and made himself available for showings and consultation whenever I needed him. Thank you, Josh!

I recently purchased my first home with Maria Vitaliano’s help. I knew nothing about the process. Maria was incredibly patient, knowledgeable and honest throughout. A true professional, and obviously a broker with years of experience in her field, Maria worked hard on making sure to understand my taste and desires. She was extremely helpful with all stages, and she was always available for a chat or another property visit. Maria came highly recommended from someone who also had an amazing experience working with her, and I have not regretted my decision at any point. Thank you for all your hard work, Maria!

Ideal Properties Group were as professional a real estate brokerage as I have ever worked with in Park Slope. They worked closely with me to assess the rental marketplace prior to listing my two apartments. They found me great tenants, and were incredibly effective in the lease signing process. I would recommend Ideal and specifically Mike Colombo’s team at Park Slope to anyone looking for help renting their inventory in Brooklyn.

Hauling to NYC from California, my girlfriend and I knew little about apartment hunting in NYC outside of hearsay from our friends (we have heard some horror stories from our friends), but when we ended up working with Luther from Ideal, we knew right away that we were in for a great experience. Luther was great, and although in the end we rented through another broker, I wanted to leave this review for Luther, in hopes his future clients have an opportunity at a similar experience. Luther went above and beyond. We could not recommend him more highly, especially now that we have worked with a number of other real estate brokers in Brooklyn.

Audrey from Lea was immensely helpful, plus dealing with her was my first ever experience with a Brooklyn broker that wasn't the usual skeez. Lea is not pushy, and she is completely upfront. She knows the Brooklyn neighborhoods inside and out, and will be the perfect asset for an apartment search, no matter how complex your requirements.

I feel like I’m in good company with quite a few satisfied customers I see Ideal has. After reading a number of reviews about James Guimaraes from Ideal, I reached out, and was happy to find the reviews were true, possibly even under-estimating the value he brings to the real estate process. James has always been promptly available for questions, and always happy to volunteer lots of good resources. James provided extremely helpful advice and offered some great ideas from beginning of my search to contract signing, and especially at the stage of evaluating and placing offers. James is a rare find, and a true asset to the real estate brokerage industry.

We had an awesome experience with the Ideal Properties Group. My partner and I were relocating to Brooklyn from Ottawa, and we had only two weekends to find an apartment. We worked with Chris, and he found us an amazing space our first weekend out. Chris also helped us get all the paperwork completed that Sunday morning, and we had flown back to Ottawa knowing we were all set - and what a tremendous relief that was!!!! Everything was done online, even our first rent payment, and we’re really ecstatic about our new place.

Because of some of their Yelp reviews, as well as their reputation in our neighborhood (Park Slope), my family decided to engage Ideal to find a suitable tenant for our property. We were amazed to have one within two days. Ideal properties Group  did all the work and the agent even came to my office in Westchester to do the final paperwork.The staff at Ideal were very professional and very accommodating. We were extremely pleased with their services and are happy to have found our broker for years to come. So far, we are very pleased with the tenant they introduced. Thank you Ideal.

These guys were great! Straightforward, transparent, friendly, efficient, knowledgeable.  I'd worked with another broker in Park Slope (OMG what a nightmare) and was disappointed with how my search turned out, but Lorraine from Ideal showed me some great apartments, and I signed my lease the same day!  Next time I look for an apartment (not anytime soon I hope), I will go to Ideal first, and likely only to Ideal.

My wife and I were looking for a 2 bedroom apartment in the South Slope and Windsor Terrace. Dari from Ideal Group was our broker and she was a real pleasure to work with. What makes her a very special realtor is that she listens to you and does her best to show apartments that are real possibilities. Dari was honest, and very helpful in finding the right apartment in the price range that would work for us. You can probably find a great apartment with Dari, and me saying this doesn’t come easily, given my previous (terrible) experiences in the city.

Our time working with Christos Drakakis was very enjoyable. He had good market knowledge and answered every question we had. He was on top of things. We got more money by going through Home Dax and I would definitely recommend him.

We've worked with HomeDax and Mohammed for three occasions: two purchases and one sale. In each instance they have worked very hard on behalf of us and sometime even go above and beyond to handled things that are not within their responsibilities. They were every on top of things and responsive. They helped us navigate through the difficult NYC market during the pandemic for over two years without complaints and were able to close the deal as soon as possible. Their prices are also very competitive, for buyers and sellers alike.I cannot be happier with them and would not hesitate to work with them again.

Chris is hands down the best broker we have ever worked with in the context of a real estate transaction (and we have been through this process many times). He was able to maintain constant communication throughout the process, provide valuable advice at all times, manage to juggle expectations between the many different parties involved (seller, seller's broker, two banks, lawyers, title company) to ensure we meet the deadlines. Several times, the transaction was at high risk of falling through but Chris persevered and flipped the situation to our advantage every single time. To the point where we were asking ourselves, "how does he do this?"! I recommend Chris to anyone looking to purchase or rent in NYC. He will make the process a breeze if the parties are cooperating, and if they aren't (like it was in our case), he is the right guy to push things through the finish line no matter the adverse circumstances. Thank you Chris from the bottom of our hearts, we cannot wait for our next condo purchase! We are available as a reference to provide more details/context if anyone needs to discuss.

Mohammed and Nick from HomeDax was great in helping me buy my first condo in New York! It was a tough time during the Pandemic but they've been super helpful and I'm really glad I went with their service! They're very responsive and professional and I would definitely recommend it to new home buyers looking for a great agent.

Buying our first home, Mohammed and Nick were extremely helpful in helping me understand the process.  It took about 2 years to finally land on our home - there were a few homes that we decided against and backed out on in between but they always supported us on our decisions. Mohammed and Nick were both patient and worked around our times and schedule without being pushy.There was also little to no lag in communication from scheduling open houses to closing and they were never afraid to explain anything real estate/home buying, even if it didn't relate to my current situation.Although there were times where I felt pressured or rushed during the offer process, resulting in a bit of stress, I know it was because Mohammed and Nick was just looking out for our best interest to ensure we secured the home we wanted.It was a good experience working with Mohammed and Nick and hope any future buyers get the same experience we did.

Purchasing a home is difficult on its own. Add a pandemic with a hot seller’s market into the mix and it becomes even more challenging. Thankfully, we were lucky enough to work with a realtor who had our best interest at heart. Christos Drakakis from Homedax Real Estate supported us as first time home buyers. He took time to help us understand the process, answering all of our questions. Christos was patient with us, showing us all the houses we were interested in and providing comps that fit what we were looking for. When there were bumps in the road he checked in to see if we were ok, helped move the process along by working with the lawyers, seller’s agent and any other parties involved. There was a moment when a house we were closing on fell through due to terms that were not fair to a buyer. Although our hearts were set on that house, Christos helped us stay level headed pointing out items that could pose issues for us in the future. There are not enough kind words for me to share regarding the support my family received from Christos and Homedax Real Estate. The process from first inquiry to closing went smoothly and was fully supported at every step of the way.

I worked with Chris Drakakis in closing on my co-op apartment, and I was very pleased with the help and attention he gave me during the process. Chris was always extremely helpful and professional throughout the whole process with me, from arranging open houses all the way through closing day. He was very knowledgeable on the home buying process and was very easy to work with. He was always available to answer my questions and guide me through, step by step. I would recommend Chris to anyone who is looking to purchase or sell their property.

Chris is amazing and I cannot say enough wonderful things about him. As first time home buyers, my wife and I were initially anxious about the whole process. Luckily for us, Chris was able to walk us through the entire process with such ease, making our first experience such a great one. He is not only extremely professional and knowledgeable, but also extremely patient and responsive (which is something that can be hard to find) and took his time to explain everything very clearly and patiently. Moreover, his calm, yet confident demeanor gave us great confidence that we would close on our new home easily. When my wife and I decide to buy again and go through the process next time, Chris will be the first phone call I make.

I've had the pleasure of working with Nick and Jason from HomeDax, who have helped me find my dream home in the city. My search for the perfect place started a year ago, and HomeDax had been patiently working with me throughout the entire process, from sending me a list of apartments that fit my criteria to scheduling open houses, and to finally getting me in contract and closing on my new apartment! I did not feel pressured to make any unwise decisions, and I felt that they genuinely care whether you find the right fit. Jason had been super responsive from the get-go, which I really appreciated, especially once I found the right place. My place had a lot of competition and he helped me get in contract very quickly and coordinated with the attorneys and seller's agent. He also helped me navigate through what seemed to be the most extensive board application ever and prepped me for the board interview. He always kept me updated, and I felt at ease and way less stressed knowing he was on top of things.Overall, I couldn't have purchased my apartment so seamlessly without help from HomeDax. I highly recommend them to be part of your team when making any real estate transactions!

I worked with Nick and Elisa to purchase my first co-op in the competitive NYC market. It's never easy purchasing a home but they helped make the transaction a relatively smooth process. Elisa worked with me personally and kept up communication with the seller's agent throughout this whole process. That was key to ensure there were no issues and kept everything in motion. If you're planning on purchasing a home in NYC, you will definitely need an agent to represent you and help guide you through all the intricacies. You will be well taken care of with HomeDax.

I had the pleasure of working with Nick Oliver as my buyer's agent. After chatting over the phone to get a sense of my situation, he sent over listings that met my criteria and budget the next day. His explanations were thorough, and he was very transparent about the home buying process. I didn't feel any pressure from him at all. I decided to postpone the search for a couple months to due personal reasons, but Nick and his team will definitely be my first point of contact when I'm ready.

We purchased a condo in NYC using Nick and the HomeDax team as our buyer's agent this past Spring. HomeDax was very responsive and professional throughout the transaction which made for an excellent overall experience!

From the beginning, HomeDax and Nick were top-notch and extremely valuable when it came time for us to sell our co-op on the Upper West Side.  I would recommend them to anyone looking to sell in NYC.

Nick helped us through the entire process. He answers phone calls and emails quickly. He also helped reach out to seller side whenever we need to schedule visit or when we have questions. Overall i think he did well at everything we expect from the real state agent.

Charles from Ideal is an excellent broker. Intelligent, extremely helpful, patient. He proved to be a very hard worker too, always taking my calls, taking the time to explain, guiding me through the rental process for my Park Slope duplex. Only at one point I felt pressured by the landlord into a decision I wasn’t comfortable making, but Charles was there to smooth everything over and make us meet and greet and talk details over until we agreed on everything. Very thoughtful, but more importantly a very dedicated broker.

Erik from Ideal Properties very easy to reach, great to work with, and incredibly knowledgeable about the market in Brooklyn. A few years back he helped us buy our townhouse, which for those of us who have been looking for a number of years prior, was not an easy task, not in this borough. Persistent, approachable, kind, empathetic, plus a fierce negotiator, Erik has it all. We feel lucky to have met him, and his team now handles our two rental units. Great group and an even better, down-to-earth leader!

In retrospect, leaving my home in Ohio and moving to Brooklyn was the most challenging experience of my life! Noel from Ideal was my advocate and I ended up buying a beautiful condo in quiet historic neighborhood. Making the move was a leap of faith and it was great having Noel by my side, with my best interest at heart. I am forever grateful to Noel and his team and management.

Aris, you are my savior! Behind me, I have a past of pushy, unprofessional, sleazy brokers, but now all those troubles are over. Aris is a great guy, plus even more importantly knowledgeable on the neighborhoods, apartment application process and has great contacts in the business. What I especially liked about Aris, and Ideal, is how his firm treats rental and sales with the same level of service. Great job, guys!

My wife and I have engaged Ideal Properties Group for the sale and purchase of our last home, and for the purchase of an investment property. Ideal’s brokers, Maria, Justin and Sebastian in particular, have helped us find exactly what we needed, they helped us achieve great sales prices, and buy for less. Thank you, Ideal! True professionals.

Charles from Ideal was fantastic throughout my search for my new place in Sunset Park. Charles really cares about his clients and takes time to make sure you understand all of the intricacies of the process. He’s a great negotiator, and from showings to signing the lease he really made me feel very comfortable. Rare find in the brokerage world.

I would highly recommend Lea Fulton at Ideal Properties Group to anyone who is looking for renting an apartment in Brooklyn. My financial situation was somewhat challenging, and required a lot of paperwork, but Lea helped me gather everything I needed, and helped me navigate the process extremely efficiently. I am convinced that my rental experience without Lea would have been a stressful mess. Lea was great at reassuring me it would all get sorted out and that I’d end up with a great place in the end. She was right.

Lance from Ideal deserves all the stars because he is an excellent broker. He was happily showing me apartments after work to fit my long-workday schedule. He was efficient, and a great negotiator. He found me exactly the apartment I was looking for, and structured a great deal. Unfortunately for me, I let doubt set in and I didn’t sign the lease on time. By the time I got to my senses, the apartment had already been rented by another Ideal broker. As for Lance, I am happy to recommend his services, as he didn’t let that hiccup deter my search, and now I’m happily moved in. Thanks, Lance!

I had a good experience with Joshua Barker. He showed me a dozen apartments that I really liked, and was very professional and reasonable throughout. In general, real estate brokers give me that "used car salesman” vibe, but Joshua is so far removed from that. He is NICE, upfront and honest. I would definitely recommend Josh as one of the nicest, most competent brokers in Brooklyn.

We had some problems in the past in finding a good apartment since my husband is self-employed and I am a stay-at-home mom. Not until a friend introduced me to Ideal Properties Group back in 2009 have we managed to find a really great space. This is our second time renting through Ideal (2013), and Ideal, this time around through the work of their agent Andrew, has helped us find the finest apartment in Cobble Hill! Ideal's agents are very friendly, and the most dedicated agents we have worked with. The apartment we rented is so fantastic. I personally would highly recommend Andrew and David of Ideal Properties because they are most likely the best, the most capable, and the most efficient brokers that Brooklyn has ever had! Plus, they're incredibly nice people. Best of luck, Ideal! Samra

I really appreciated all the help Caliber did for me. I was very desperate looking for a new place, since my budget was not the best and I had some expectations. I met with an agent from Caliber and he showed me more than 10 places. We spent half day looking for the right apartment before putting down an application on one I really loved. I was really happy I came across this Real Estate firm; they sure know what they are doing! Thanks again!

I had to write this so my fellow Brooklynites would know how impressed I am with Ideal Properties Group as a seller’s broker. My experience with this company was a true pleasure.  They managed my sale flawlessly, from impeccable marketing to the closing table, Ideal handled every stage with little to no effort from me.

My husband and I feel spoiled after working with Maria Vitagliano on our first home purchase. We had a difficult time finding an agent who would make our interests their number one priority. Maria was honest, incredibly knowledgable, friendly, efficient and completely understood where we were coming from and what we were trying to find. Maria was always on point and she never once showed disinterest in our schedules or desires. What really stood out is that Maria went the extra mile over and over again throughout us buying our home in Brooklyn. Maria referred us to an excellent home inspector, termite inspector, and a fantastic mortgage broker, and she expertly handled all of the logistics. Maria really helped minimize our stress, and we are extremely grateful.

Rashida from Ideal is amazing. She helped us get a dream apartment in a beautiful well-maintained building exactly in the neighborhood we wanted to live in, and the entire process of working with her was simply wonderful. When we walked around Brooklyn with Rashida looking for an apartment, a number of people stopped her to say hello and to thank her for her work, and right then and there we knew that we had somehow managed to find the right realtor.Rashida went through great pains to understand EXACTLY what we were looking for in, and only showed us places that were an EXACT fit. AND they were all within our budget. She is honest, helpful, and all around a pleasure to work with. Hiring her to help you find your home in Brooklyn will be one of those decisions you pat yourself on the back for, for years to come.

When my mom died, Arlene was recommended by a friend of hers. Arlene had sold her $MM home. I know a number of Park Slope realtors and was going to use one of them. Arlene made an excellent and competitive presentation and was selected. She remained professional, committed and dedicated. In the post-2009 market crash, she did numerous open houses, advertising, follow ups, negotiations, etc. She returned phone calls and emails almost 24/7. Even if I wanted to, which I don't, I can't say a bad word about Arlene. Rather, let me say three good words: excellent, dedicated, and successful

This was my first purchase with Arlene.  As an experienced home buyer I appreciated Arlene's patience, diligence, negotiating skills and  follow through.  Working with an agency that's professional but  not a chain franchise  with tons of rules and regulations was a pleasure.  It  allowed me the opportunity to negotiate  for what I wanted and needed and what was in my best interest.  That's something you don't get when you  deal with a big franchise agency.  I would definitely work with Arlene again and highly recommend her and her  agency.

Ellisha and I wanted to thank you for the great service and dedication that you all demonstrated in leasing our two apartments earlier this month. We came to you in dire need of advice and guidance which the whole team provided with patience, professionalism, local knowledge and courtesy.

We could definitely not have reached this outstanding result with out the dedication and knowledge of the team at Awaye Realty.

I needed to come up with a listing price for my home which I was putting up for sale in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.  I called up East Coast and Steve came out and did an appraisal of my home.  He provided me with a written appraisal within a week.  I felt it was thorough and fair.   This was important to me because I wanted to attract buyers with a home priced right and so that buyers would be able to obtain financing.  It's a waste of everyone's time if the buyer's bank does an appraisal and it does not appraise for the sales price.  I felt I could rely on the appraisal in setting the right price.  Steve was professional and friendly and he even called me up after I received the appraisal to see if I had any questions. As a home seller, I would definitely recommend this company to provide you with peace of mind.

"GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. I was overwhelmed in filing for bankruptcy. My attorney informed me that I should get an appraisal since this was the best way to prove the value of my house. He recommended East Coast Appraisal Service to me.  Due to the fact that I worked two jobs, my availability for an appointment was extremely limited.  When I called their office and explained my situation I was told the appraiser would be calling me within twenty minutes to set up an appointment that was convenient for me. Within ten minutes the appraiser called and actually came to my house 6pm on a Sunday night.  Within forty eight hours I received a call from my attorney that he already received the appraisal report and not to worry. I was so relieved. It’s good to know that there are still companies out there that actually practice what they preach when it comes to customer service"

I am an attorney in Brooklyn, NY with a substantial real estate related practice. Our firm recently engaged East Coast Appraisal and Michael Pavlakos to serve as an expert witness in a substantial landlord-tenant matter that was being tried in Kings County. Mr. Pavlakos was extremely well prepared for his appearance in court and was poised on the witness stand. Mr. Pavlako's assistance was very helpful in achieving our desired results in the litigation. I recommend Mr. Pavlakos and his firm highly as expert witness in real estate related cases.

We have been doing business with East Coast Appraisal Service for over 10 years and have assigned them many high-end and complex assignments throughout the 5-boroughs along with the Hamptons. The value on many of theses properties, especially in Manhattan, typically exceed $1,000,000.00 Our Borrowers were impressed with their professionalism and demeanor. Their appraisal quality and turn around time were good. They worked well with our large processing staff and were willing and flexible to accommodate the typically busy schedules of our high-net worth borrowers.

I took a chance on this company, after having a pleasant conversation with (M).  I was not familiar with them, because I live in another state.  They sent the appraisal to me by fed ex, before any payment was received.  It was presented quite professionally, and I was satisfied with the work.  They are reasonably priced, and their customer service is courteous.  I would recommend this company without hesitation.

Viktoria from Ideal was a pleasure to work with and I'd highly recommend you get in touch with her if you are in the market for a smooth and stress-free buying experience in Brooklyn!

Nick from Ideal was very attentive and professional. He found me a lovely apartment in Bed-Stuy with great amenities and a friendly super… just as I requested. Tough business, real estate in NYC, but to Nick it seems to come natural and he makes it all seem easy. Great agent to have on your side if and when you need one.

These guys really get it. I found it really difficult in Brooklyn to find respectable brokers who are also friendly, and great people. I worked with Ideal for my last two apartment searches and I couldn't have been happier with the results. I loved my first apartment, and unfortunately had to move after temporarily losing a job. Anyway, Ideal is terrific!

AP from Ideal has been a super helpful and super friendly broker, assisting me and my wife in our search for our new place in Brooklyn. He was very patient with us, and our many small changes in mind, diligent in his apartment qualification and research, and he always knew all the right questions to ask of the property owner, at all times making sure that we get all the important details uncovered in a timely fashion. Great broker, and definitely someone you need to have on your side while looking for an apartment in Brooklyn.

David from Ideal made the apartment hunt as seamless, pleasant, and positive as it probably could have been in Brooklyn. He was extremely helpful, reliable, and made everything simple and to the point. Working with him was a pleasure! I don’t know much about anyone else in the firm, but the experience I’ve had with David was excellent. Totally worth the call… and even the fee.

Curtis helped us in our rental search and was a pleasure to work with from the very beginning to the end. He was always on time to all of our appointments, he was extremely  knowledgeable of all of the options out there. He was available, and he was friendly. If you are looking for a real estate agent familiar with Williamsburg and its rental quirks and the best apartments to see, Curtis is the broker you have to call.

Mike from Ideal was our agent and made our renting in Park Slope very easy and enjoyable. Thanks Mike so much for our perfect little apartment. Sorry, our perfect BIG apartment (can you tell we just moved from the Village?)

Alex is an amazing broker. He was so incredibly patient and didn't push any of the apartments he showed me. He made my search for an apartment in Williamsburg very easy and although I am ecstatic with where I currently live, I will definitely reach out to Alex if I have to move again.

I've read plenty of negative reviews about Pan Am on yelp and so to share my opinion, I added my own review about PanAm on Yelp, and it was hidden under "reviews that are not recommended." So here's hoping this will be seen?I don't understand the majority of the negative reviews on Yelp. On second thought, I do. But none of these issues relate directly to them. These are issues every New Yorker has unless they're paying 5M+ for their apartment. And even then I've heard similar stories or different but far worse...I've had nothing but the best experience with PanAm in my last 4 years. Most of the negative reviews are all things that people deal with in ny, no matter who the landlord. I've been living in Manhattan for over 25 years now and have moved around a lot. Probably 15 apartments total. I've had the experience of several different landlords. Maybe 3 or 4 that I can think of off the top of my head that were as responsive to my needs as PanAm. My super has always helped me out whenever I need it, and if for some reason I can't reach the super, I contact Pan Am and if I'm emailing late at night I always have an answer the next morning or latest early afternoon. They've even addressed some of my issues with tenants by sending out flyers to the entire building.Mostly, I've been angered by the reviews on yelp because I've recommended PanAm buildings to friends and family, who then always stumble across their reviews and second guess themselves and my opinion. I've typically been able to sway them since they've all spent time at my apartment and don't have anything but nice things to say. I don't want my friends, family, and coworkers to think I'm making poor recommendations when I know that its the opposite.Anyway, maybe one day my review will be approved by Yelp. Who knows, since I've always had issues with reviews showing up for restaurants, my laundromat, my dog groomer... they pick and choose as they see fit. I don't really get it.

Renting from Pan Am Equities is so easy and stress free. I was able to quickly lock something in with Mirador and moved into a gorgeous renovated building. I even requested an additional cleaning before moving in and they actually accommodated my request. I have had such trouble with small asks from management companies in the past. Everyone who I have communicated with via Pan Am's resident relations has been pleasant and wonderful. They even have a super cute email newsletter that features building pets! This is a company that actually cares about making people comfortable. So hard to find that from a real estate company in NYC.

My experience with Pan Am at their building in SoHo was fantastic. I was only there for one year but never had any problems. After moving out I actually got my deposit back! Had so many problems with this in the past. I'm unhappy with my current landlord and wish I had chosen to upgrade to another Pan Am apt. Oh well.
 -

I have been pleased with the management after moving into Gramercy Park Lofts. Everything you need out of a landlord. I agree with the comments made by Liz. The reviews of Pan Am Equities on Yelp have little to do with management, and much more to do with life as renter in NYC. In my opinion, Pan Am Equities makes the New York apartment experience a little bit better.

So rare to find an excellent landlord in NYC. Having lived in my share of apartments, I've dealt with more than a few headaches-- supers who won't fix the shower, landlords who won't return your call. My experience with Pan Am has been quite the opposite. My super is a joy and I've had a great experience with management every time I've called in. I plan to renew this August.

Happy to finally find a legit landlord who cares about their tenants and maintaining their properties. Lived at two of their properties so far, have never had a problem with maintenance, paying rent, or renewals. Very easy to contact them, pleasant to work with. Wish more landlords could be like them.

I've been living in a Pan Am building on 16th street for over a year now and am tremendously happy with both my apartment and my landlord. Our building was recently renovated-- stylish accents were added to the common areas and high tech amenities were introduced. I'm excited to see what Pan Am has in store for us next!More importantly, our super is alway attentive to our needs. My roommate and I feel safe and secure in our NYC abode.

Cooper & Cooper was such a blessing.  Jordan Cooper (one of the principals) contacted me himself in order to set up an appointment and really took the time to understand my needs, requirements, and deadline.  Even though we were moving in about a month, we had to find an apartment that specific week due to other work commitments, which would only leave us one week before our scheduled move.  Jordan set me up with one of the firm's managers (Genevieve) and we met the next day.  Genevieve met with us at our hotel and took us from the Upper East Side to the Lower East Side.  We saw about eight apartments, all ranging in sizes, prices, and amenities.  She was friendly, professional, organized, efficient, right on spot with the timings, and responsive.  We made the decision to go with a wonderful complex in the Upper East Side, steps away from the subway station, within blocks of Central Park.  Although it was on the higher end of our budget, we could not be more happy with our choice.  Genevieve even managed to negotiate our monthly rent down and include two years of free gym membership in the building (savings of $1200!).  Jordan personally attended the lease signing in order to answer any question we might have had and show support.  Cooper & Cooper even offered to oversee the movers if we were too busy!In any case, our experience with Jordan and Genevieve could not have been any better.  My wife and I felt like they really cared about us and about their reputation.  Every firm has good agents and bad agents.  But we thank Cooper & Cooper and know we would've never found this complex without them.

HANDS DOWN THE BEST!! I know what you're thinking. How is it possible for a real estate brokerage in New York City to have so many 5 star reviews? I am here to echo 100+ reviewers that these guys are the real deal. From the moment I called them, I could tell they were different. They were friendly, responsive, made sure I was prepared with my documents (letter from my employer, bank statement, pay stubs, etc) and willing to meet me on short notice (I had been left for dead by one of the big agencies, and running out of time to find a place). Cooper & Cooper came to my rescue, thank goodness!  They have tons of access to great buildings across the city. I looked in a few different neighborhoods with my agent before settling on a fantastic 2 bedroom. Approval was quick, I signed the lease and done! Finding an apartment can be super-stressful, but it doesn't have to be. Give these folks a call, they won't disappoint!!

I've moved plenty of times, used somewhere between 5-6 different firms while moving and have probably seen upwards of 30 brokers in this span of time. So I've learned all the little tricks and how horrible the managements usually are. I've worked with 2 agents from this company as well as dealt with the owner.The main difference I see is these guys we're much more honest about any negative situation, which I suppose may make them seem worse at first, but I appreciate honesty over anything, especially when it comes to where I'm going to live for several years. They have a good mix of younger and older agents at the office which seems to make a better dynamic, also it's a very communal office, so if one agent is helping you, you have assistance from others who may have some solid information.

Everybody knows apartment hunting in Manhattan can be a pain... It wasn't easy for me too, but after endless appointments with unhelpful brokers I finally met Eran from GZ Brokers ( Gamlieli Zweig ), the guy knows his job and the city, got me the absolutely best apartment after seeing more tan 20 units before meeting with him...  He also negotiated the rent for me, got me $200 off, not bad... And his managers were great too, walked me all the way to lease signing in the most professional way. And that's pretty rare in Manhattan, if you spend time searching for an apartment here you would know, that's why I decided to write a review for them.

I Just felt that I had to write this...After walking around uptown, downtown...and all over. seeing tones of apts..all kind...wasting over two month with unprofessional brokers... I finally met Aly from GZ Brokers, who spent hours and hours showing me apts. always with a big smile on her face. never tried to convince me on apt just because she liked it.... she was actually listening to what i'm interested in, and what I like about the places, and never tried to rush anything, unlike other brokers. her work is very professional and I had a blast working with her. would definitely recommended to all my friends and co-workers.

Nader works hard! It is not easy to sell a house in this market especially a 1800's brownstone with issues. Also, it was estate sale. The people buying the house were not always cooperating either. Nader kept the process moving forward and we got a very fair price for our home. I am very thankful to Nader.

Nader, sold my waterfront condo in jersey city in 2 weeks. It all came down to understanding what our needs for selling were and educating my husband and I on the local market conditions. He executed a plan and in 2 weeks we were under contract. If you want a knowledgable, straight forward Realtor to get the job done, you should really call Nader. -TB

Nader Rezai is very knowledgeable and when I sold my condo, he made sure he knew what my goal was and he did a great job at letting me know what to expect. In turn, I used Nader Rezai to buy a brownstone in Hoboken New Jersey and again his knowledge of the market and his real-estate expertise were invaluable and made the process a complete success.

After getting the run around from another real estate firm, I decided to contact LoHo Realty. Their realtors were nothing like what I expected. They actually listened to what I wanted and did everything to ensure that I found an apartment I loved at an affordable price. The realtors treated me with courtesy and respect, and I will gladly recommend them to anyone.

As a mother, I want the best for my daughter, and that’s exactly what she got when she worked with Doris. This was my daughter’s first time looking for an apartment, and I was afraid that she would be taken advantage of and be pushed into selecting an apartment that was too expensive. Thankfully, LoHo Realty is an honest real estate company, and working with Doris confirmed this. She took great care of my daughter and ensured that she got exactly what she was looking for. Doris walked us through the entire process, leaving nothing out. Now, thanks to the excellent service we received, my daughter is happily living in her own apartment at an affordable price.

Michael is by far the best realtor I have ever had. Professional, kind, and very real; unlike many realtors/brokers in the NYC area. He listens to you and is very timely. I was running late to a showing I had with him and he actually went out of his way to pick me up! The guy is awesome. Michelle in the office is just as great! Kind, professional and efficient in ensuring the application is as strong as possible for the landlord. If you are looking for a place in Astoria, call Michael. There may not be a listing up that fits your needs, but he will go out of his way to find it for you!Thanks Mac Realty!

He is been in the game for years and continually educates himself of the current laws.  I will never do my own taxes again, and you shouldn't either.  Try once and you'll see for yourself.Richard

I had a great experience with Oliver in taking care of my somewhat complex 2016 taxes. I thoght the Zamora Tax & Immigration team seemed collaborative, focused, and very friendly. We noticed that Oliver despite being very busy, always took the time to walk me out and chat about me and my family, etc. after each meeting. He seemed to take a personal interest in both my taxes and us ! He took the time to research the particulars of our returns and proactively explored different, legitimate deductions I may be able to claim. Oliver's a pro. I'll use him again in the future.

I've been going to Zamora Tax & Immigration for about 6 years now. I've never had any problems making an appointment and the customer service has always been friendly. The past years taxes are filed in their database so there's little effort in filling out any paperwork. So no mistakes like in different places that I went before.  I'm not there to chit-chat or for social hour. Their employees goes through all my tax forms, asks questions, looks at the receipts and tells me whats eligible for tax deductions. My wife and I are typically done with our whole return within 30 minutes. We sign the papers and our check refund is there in a week. Great Services.It's a no-fuss; no-headache solution to my income tax needs every year.

Sharon's transcription service is fantastic.  We needed a three hour talk radio show transcribed fast.  I called several transcription services but Sharon was the only one to ask what I was going to do with the document.  I explained that the show was an interview of the owner of our company by a fast talking host with many callers. We are going to put the transcription on our website. She then gave me the choice of a verbatim transcription or she would remove the "ums" and stuttered words to give me a more readable document. No other service offered to do this and it was just what we needed.In just a few days I had the finished product.  I read the document and listened to the show.   It was perfect!Thank you Sharon!  I definitely recommend Sharon's service.

Folks, if you want fast, accurate and reliable service, then Sharon’s Secretarial Service is the right place to go.  I have personally used Sharon's Secretarial Service on a few occasions and I was impressed from the first time I spoke with Sharon by telephone.  The transcription service she performed was all done by sending her several large voice recordings in which she transcribed and sent the file copy by return email in MS Word format.  When you have tried the rest only settle for the best, call Sharon’s Secretarial Service and like me, you will be glad you did.  Please give me a call and I will whole heartedly endorse her services.Ronald Carmouche(951) 678-3074rjcarmouche2@verizon.net

First off let me say that there is a reason why I have been going to Victor for 15+ years!!! I own a corporation now coming up on 30 years. I wish I would have started working with Victor sooner. Not only does he do my taxes for me but he is also my financial advisor and has also helped me with setting up different health care options for my family and I. Victor is highly attentive and professional along with his knowledge and expertise in many areas. I have seen previous reviews on here for minimal stars for wait times because they were not being attended to or also on how busy Mr.Martinez can be, honestly being a business owner myself  that is a quality problem to have due to his high demand for great services that he provides. I highly recommend him to all my family members and friends which who are all satisfied with his services. Victor would never stir you wrong and is very compassionate for your own unique personal situation. I would never go anywhere else. ~Rick Palomo

I was referred to go to Martinez income tax by my mother in law, so I went for my first time and this was my experience:It is in the heart of San Fernando Valley where you do park on the side street, but plenty of room to park. So knowing I made my appointment ahead of time, I did have to wait for about an hour, due to only so many working that day and people with their walk ins to get their taxes done. But despite the waiting because what it comes down to is their customer service, knowledge, friendliness, and them being quick made up for it. They charge a very reasonable rate and I strongly feel that I definitely got my money back worth.Also FYI, they only take cash, debit or credit cards and do work off of referrals that can save you up to $10-$20 a person. So if you want a place you can trust and get the job done, then go to Martinez income tax. Here is their website too at Martinezincometax.com

Hands down this is the best law firm that I've used. Ms. Mathis and Mr. Carpenter was very helpful throughout the entire case. I mainly was assisted by Ms. Mathis and she was great. Any time I had a question or concern she gave me a clear explanation. Response times were phenomenal. I've never had to sit and wonder if they received my email message or phone call. I'm  still amazed at the service and outcome of my case. I know 5 stars are the max that you can rate  a company but they truly deserve 10+ stars. Thank you again for providing excellent service. I will definitely refer any of my friends/family that's in need of legal assistance to your firm. Continue the great work and I hope you all continue to thrive.

Used these guys to help me with my offer in compromise. They filed tax returns and reduced my back tax debt. I am now in great shape and saved thousands.

First I would like to say that I am completely at fault for falling so far in my back-taxes. I was w-2 then 11 years ago switched to 1099. Needless to say, I couldnt afford my taxes due. I waited and waited but was never able to catch up. One day I was hit with a bank levy and wage garnishment. I called Anderson Bradshaw Conusltants because enough was enough. They stopped the garnishment within two days. It took longer(of course) to completely fix my tax mess, but they did. Completely honest and worth it. definite recommend!!

I am a truck driver and have been for 25 years. For the past 10 years I went without filing my taxes. I have back taxes, a levy, A bank Levy, And my wages were about to be garnished. I called Anderson Bradshaw consultants and within seven hours they stopped my bank levy. And released my wage garnishment. I am on the road to being settled with the IRS and state taxes. Also, I can go back to work without any worry.

I didn't get what I thought I would get when I paid for my daughter's tax case to be handled by this group. She ended up paying as much as she would if we had just done it ourselves. I should have just kept the $3000 I spent with them. Didn't meet expectations they set up front. Not a good experience.

I was a bit nervous at first trusting a company I found online to help me with taxes, but John immediately put me at ease. I owed over $75,000 to the IRS and had a number of missing tax returns and the IRS had already put a wage garnishment on my pay and had just hit my bank account for a sizable chunk of change. Within 24 hours of signing up John put me in touch with an ABC Attorney who got me my money back from the IRS and stopped the wage garnishment. I was kept informed throughout the process and every step was explained to me to make sure I knew what was happening. At the end, I only ended up having to pay the IRS $2,500. I cannot recommend Anderson Bradshaw enough.

I had not filed for 13 years!!!!! I decided to get married so I had to file but didn't have any w-2's or payroll tax information or deductions. Anderson Bradshaw took care of all of that for me. Now I am all caught up on my taxes and it feels great. I didn't even have to do a thing.

I came to Anderson Bradshaw with a $36,000 tax liability. After speaking with Mr. King, he put me in good hands with Josh Kronick. He immediately protected me from IRS Collection action, informed me every step of the way for what to expect from the process, and ultimately delivered me an Offer-in-Compromise that settled my tax burden for $500. I cannot recommend this firm enough. They gave me a fresh lease on life. Thank you!

When we received a letter from the IRS saying my daughter owed them over $18,000 for income in 2013, we nearly had heart attacks! Her U.S. income in that year was only around $5,000, because that was the year she started teaching in Asia. Calls to the IRS gleaned only a little information, but it appeared that an ex of hers had accessed her PayPal account, sold his products online, but not forwarded the information to her nor did he tell her about it. I found Anderson Bradshaw online, contacted them, and after working with Josh and Ted for a short period, they managed to get it all cleared up and proper paperwork filed to clear her of all liabilities. We could not have done it without their help, and I will be eternally appreciative.

I am a United States Navy Veteran, who recently found himself in hot water with IRS . They wanted all these old returns and W-2' s that I haven't seen in years . I called around for help but the tax preparers could only go back 2 years. The other tax firms wouldn't return my call. It was only when I contacted Anderson Bradshaw and spoke to Ted England that I was finally able to get the help that I needed. I am not some rich guy or some huge company ; however, Ted was willing to take the time to get my issue resolved. Thanks to Anderson Bradshaw Tax Consultants I am finally able to get my life back from the IRS.

I was paying the IRS $400 a month for 2 years and I was getting NO WHERE!  When I initially set it up I didn't realize how much they charged for penalties and interest.  It's down right criminal (but that's whole different story) Last summer, things got pretty tough for my wife and I, we were robbing Peter to pay Paul and we just couldn't keep up with the payment any longer.  I had spoke with a few companies a couple years back when all of this started, but they didn't seem like they could offer too much help.  Thankfully I found Anderson Bradshaw through YP and I'm really happy that I did!  I spoke with Ted, he was very patient and answered all of my questions through out the consultation. He explained our options and mapped out a step by step outline of how they were going to resolve our case. There's finally a light at the end of the tunnel for us and they saved us quite a bit of money in the end.  Thank so much for ending this nightmare & getting us that Fresh Start you promised

I CALLED ANDERSON BRADSHAW TAX CONSULTANTS. EXPECTING MR.BRADSHAW, GOT TED ENGLAND .HE SEEMED PROFESSIONAL AND KNOWLEDGEABLE,SMART. CAN ANYONE HONESTLY TELL ME WHAT TO EXPECT FROM HIM.IS HE FOR REAL OR WANNABE?

When I began my search for a tax attorney, it was my understanding  "serve this area" would have been completed in the state I resided.  My paperwork made it across the country from Los Angeles, California to Baltimore, Maryland.  The same paperwork had to be submitted twice, one for each office.   I would have felt more comfortable if the paperwork could have been handled once.   I know that I would have felt more confident  if I could have worked with the same person the whole way through the process.
 -

I cannot recommend ANDERSON BRADSHAW highly enough. There is always a courteous person to answer my questions and I personally work with Bill Davis most all the time. He has dealt with all my inept questions and queries. My account is not completely settled but is moving right along and the results are definitely are meeting my approval! My husband and I had ourselves in a real mess and they are getting things worked out really well. If you have any doubts about this company...don't hesitate to HIRE THEM ASAP!

I'm happy to write this review. I called ABC Tax two months ago when the IRS put a lien on my home and levied my wages. I was in $85,000 in debt to the IRS from when I started my own business many years ago. I never made any money in that business and now the IRS is threatening to take everything I have. As soon as I was transferred to Jeff, he put my mind at ease.  He is very knowledgable about tax help and tax resolution. He told me that he can stop the levy that day. and that I could settle my tax bill for only 5k. You guys did what you promised and now that I am paying back my reduced amount, The irs is removing the lien on my home and now I have a fresh start.
 -

These guys got the lien removed on my bank account in one day, and set up payments to the IRS that I could afford. Thanks, A-B!

My own accountant was useless. These guys were really able to negotiate with the IRS and got my tax bill cut in half. So glad I found Anderson Bradshaw.

My wife works as independent contractor and we got careless about quarterly deposits so after about 2 years we owed way too much. We looked around and this guy calmed us down and was able to get us some kind of compromise with the IRS  and payments that we can now afford. yes, we recommend them.

They have been doing my tax return and my family's tax return for years and I wouldn't trust anyone else to handle my taxes. They are fair and honest. Also, their prices are very reasonable compared to H&R and Liberty. I'm just saying. I recommend that you check them out. I don't think you will be disappointed.

They forgot to file my 2013 state income tax on time and I got a late penalty fee. I tried calling Michael, the son of the owner Connie to address the issue. Then he says he is in a hospital on a family emergency, but later I find out he was taking a state tax board exam and lied about the whole thing (his friend was a friend of mine coincidentally and told me he posted his status on FB). He said he would get back to me and never did. Not very respectable in my eyes. Not going back and taking people with me.

A tax preparer whom I have worked with for years turned out to be stealing from me. Michelle Moya Pearl stole my stimulus money, opened fraudulent accounts using my identity, and screwed me on my latest tax return when I began connecting the dots. Absolutely scandalous, this company is well aware of her wrong doings. Don't trust these people with your information or money.

Being legally bound to financial jargons all my life, I faced some tax evasion issues last year where I was going to be rendered superfluous by the court if they had acquitted me. Even though I was right in my own terms, with the help of OMG Tax, they efficiently discovered the fissures in the data I kept. It was truly an astounding experience.

Five of us with a little kid were driving from San Diego it was Sat around 11.00 & we landed up here in India's Grill. The owner greeted us with such a warm feeling that we forgot all the driving stress. We were treated with nice hot cup of Masala Chai ( Tea) and superb food. Very well cooked - mind you lot of Indian food place are very high on Cream. But not this place. The Food was cooked perfect. An Excellent place to get real Desi Khana. All the very best.

These were complicated jobs and they were done in professional timely manner, with a reasonable price tag and a great guarantee of 25 years or more. The team was friendly and worked fast, also taking care not disrupt our household. The even did a wonderful job cleaning up afterwards. One of the jobs was an complete new sewer line connection from the house to the street which was completed in three days! Thank you Power Pro for hiring such amazing folks and it's always a pleasure to work with a family owned company! We feel like part of their family!

I really appreciate all the people who helped me at Power Pro Plumbing and HIGHLY recommend them. From my phone calls with Amy and Maria to the service provided by Erik P., I was taken care of in the most professional and kind manner.  They provide excellent customer service that is efficient and considerate.  They keep you updated every step of the process.  My Plumber, Erik, so far exceeded any expectations.  He really, really knows what he is doing and is innovative  with solutions.  My bathroom facet installation had been badly botched by a handy man who left literally, everything, from the facet and sink to the workings under the sink, broken.  Erik fixed it all in a short amount of time and had to engineer some solutions on the spot.  Which he did with no worries or stress.  He really understood the trauma a bad handyman can leave behind and was so helpful to me in the situation. Call them.  You will be glad you did.

No more leaks! Robert came on a Saturday to fix my leaky tub. He was very clear with details of what the issue was.  He fix it in no time.  He also offered to check out my water heater just to make sure everything was working well. He spotted a leak and all the corrosion, it will need to be replaced. Robert definitely be the plumber to do it.  I'm glad I called power pro plumbing, they are efficient and professional. They saved me from a huge potential water damage nightmare!

I had a terrific experience with Power Pro Plumber and will continue to use them in the future.  They were professional, knowledgeable and efficient.  We had a pinhole leak in our downstairs bathroom that flooded our garage.  Power Pro fixed the problem and provided solutions to prevent the issues moving forward.  The technician educated me throughout the process providing me with a good understanding of the problem and resolution.  They were able to fix the leak and replace our broken regulator in a timely manner.  I would highly recommend Power Pro to others looking for a plumber.

Watch out! These guys will rip you off! They have numerous phone numbers and service most of Southern California. They have ads on the front page of the phone book and big two page spreads inside. They offer free estimates to get one of their rip off artists in the door.We noticed water coming up through the hardwood floors and we were very concerned. We called them out and they met with my fiance. The guy said he would have to do a video snake but never quoted a price. Then when she told him the clean-out was behind the dishwasher, he said it wasn't and he needed to cut a hole in the wall and pipe to see it. She trusted him and the guy ran the snake. He said a 4 foot section of pipe was disintegrated and they would need to jackhammer through the slab to get to it. This was the worst case scenario and we were scarred. He said this would run at least $5000, She called me and I told her to have him stop immediately and we would get a second opinion. He charged us $1250 and left after 4 hours. When I came home that night, I called up a friend of mine who is a union pipe fitter. He said he would bring over all the tools and we could do the work ourselves. We ended up jack hammering a 5 foot trench in the bathroom to get to this "disintegrated" pipe. Of course once we did all of this damage, we found no disintegrated pipe. I was infuriated. We went to Home Depot and got a snake. The snake went through the pipe no problem. There was a minor hair clog at a T and we went ahead and replaced that portion of the pipe since we were already under the slab. The next day, I had a Mike Diamond Plumber come out and run a snake and he said there was no resistance going from the back of the house to the curb.  He also said that this company is known for ripping people off. Whatever you do, do not let these guys in your house!!!

Nathan got to our house, he knew it would take longer to do than that and was honest about it.  He agreed to come the next day, two hours before his shift, to accommodate us, even knowing it would be raining and the job was outside.  He showed up on Sunday, got to work and was done in time for us to meet our appointment.  He was kind, professional and very pleasant!  Also,  there was no extra charge for weekend rates plus we got a new customer discount!!  Oh, and we now have hot water which is awesome.  Thank you very much!!!!

Our downstairs Plumbing backed this morning. Handling a Plumbing problem was not a part of my busy schedule this morning. I called Power Pro Plumbing, and they sent their Amazing service Tech Joseph out to help us with our Problem.  I watched Joseph carefully and thoroughly source our problem and within 45 minutes of his arrival our Plumbing was unclogged and working nicely. Thank you, Power Pro and thanks, Joseph. It is nice to work with a Plumbing Company that is thorough and focusses on quality!

I wanted a local Antioch business to do the work required and I found it was a pleasure doing business with American Plumbing.  Their service is high quality, 100% professional and reasonably priced.  The technicians are courteous, likeable people and they take much pride in the work they do.  The work was finished in exactly the amount of time they originally estimated and the cost came in under the quoted figure.  I couldn't have asked for better service.  Nicely done!

The hot water wasn't working in our showers. They not only fixed the problem but also recommended other fixes to ensure our system was working optimally. They were the first plumbing company to come and actually take the time to find the best solution. Two other plumbers had suggested a number of options but never actually addressed the real problem. Thanks for taking the time to do it right!

After 10 years in the same house with the original builder's kitchen, it was time for a much needed kitchen upgrade. I'm a very detail oriented person, and research overkill is my motto. You can never do enough when committing to such a large and important project. We were very fortunate that it paid off. I'm extremely pleased with the remodeling.Jacob and his team were tremendous and very helpful every step of the way. They provided cost-effective suggestions and were highly responsive to every concern. The contractors were highly professional, punctual, and kind. They stayed very close to the original budget and timeline. We now need to upgrade the rest of the house. Thank you guys. I look forward to working with you gents again!

I had less than a week to have tub fixtures and drainage to be replaced for a pending renovation. They responded to the request immediately and set up an inspection the next morning.Jacob made us feel confident the job could be accomplished and offered a quote that was within market norms. It was completed within 6 hours. A really good experience.

The whole process from granite selection to installation was a lot easier than expected. Making an appointment was also painless. The remodelers were friendly, clean and took great care of us and our house. In addition, the materials used were very nice and made our kitchen look completely new. We were given updates on a daily basis according to the work schedule they gave us. The craftsmanship was clearly superior and made sure the remodeling project was perfect! I am totally impressed and will use them for when we decide to remodel the bathrooms. Beautiful work from Express Plumbing and Remodeling!

The workers arrived as scheduled and they kept the house and yard free of debris throughout the remodeling of our kitchen and bathrooms. The company was also willing to accommodate any changes we had as the project progressed. It was a very smooth process I'm really impressed.We were never surprised by any additional costs and were also able to save a couple of items by sourcing them ourselves. It was all a pleasure to have worked with everyone and we receive many compliments on our newly remodeled bathrooms and kitchen. 😊I and my husband would definitely recommend talking to Express Plumbing and Remodeling if you are considering remodeling your home. Thank you!

Thank you Razor Rooter Plumbing. I called these guys to clear out my drains upon completion of their work. They offered to perform a free plumbing inspection, and in this inspection they revealed some excessive heat in my garage coming from my hot water heater which I believed to be normal, but actually they informed me that my heater was not functioning properly and that carbon monoxide had been leaking into my garage and not going up  the vent pipe in the ceiling  which is very dangerous. I am happy that I called them.  My garage is nice and cool now and safe. Thanks a million Martin. Judy Politte

The Razor Rooter Plumbing company gave us the BEST quote on repair of our sewerline, they ran the camera to show the problem areas, then they installed a sewer clean out at the front yard, then they cleaned out all the roots with their hydrojetter, they did a neat and clean job, very professional, recommend highly. Five Stars!

We have had the same plumber for 9 years, and when we have needed him most which is usually at night, he had referred us to Roto Rooter. So we have found a new plumber Martin with Razor Rooter he has worked on our condominiums after hours as well as our home here in San Gabriel, he travels and doesn't charge insane overtime wages. Our plumber from now on.

I had a problem with my shower faucet upstairs in my home, it leaked through my ceiling ,and I called a plumber and he said he would come out between 5pm and 6pm. well he never showed up or called. I decided to call a local plumber in Alhambra Martin came out, fixed my leak by tightening the shower head pipe, he said it would be $89.00 over the phone. he charged only $49.00  and gave me a guarantee for his work, thanks Martin muah !

Our main drain was clogged and we had several plumbing company's come out for free estimates, some never came out  because they charge for estimates $29.00. well we were told that our plumbing needed to be updated basically by several plumbers and plumbing company's. one left an estimate for $ 3,500 another for $2,200 a third plumber told us he couldn't even do anything for us. we finally called Razor rooter in the phone book, their service was fast, fair and professional, they hopped up on our roof and cleared our line with a very long snake as soon as they arrived, they didn't try to sell us a brand new plumbing system or anything like that. well they cleared our blockage which was large long roots that came from the tree in font of our house, a magnolia that the city planted almost 20 years ago, it turns out that the city came by and repaired the sewer which was their property. Razor Rooter was very good and we recommend them highly  to anyone in need of this service.

I called two other plumbing companys and they were extremely high priced and out of my budget, which was 0 since my plumbing issue was unexpected I just was not prepared for what the solution had to offer. LUCKILY I called  Martin from Razor rooter, He hoped up on my roof and ran his snake down the pipe into the main drain and cleared my drains. and for much more than half the cost of what the other guys estimate was, and guaranteed his work. what a life saver this guy is. 10 stars to him. thankyou again Martin I'll call you again forsure.

I called Pritz Plumbing when our toilet clogged. Pritz Plumbing sent a plumber out name "John" he showed up in about 30 minutes to fix the problem. Very happy with the service and price. If you live in the LA area, you should have their phone number, just in case.

We had a clogged sewer drain problem and we called Express plumbing and rooter because we used them before and we were really satisfied. Victor showed up a little earlier than the time line and went right to work. He was very knowledgeable and explained the situation and options very clearly. What I thought was a simple unclog the drain turned into a 4 day job. Every day Victor came back smiling and polite. Walked me through every step and would show me the progression. He even went beyond and contacted my landlord and spoke with them to make sure they were informed and knew what was going on as well. Turned out that we needed to replace the entire pipe line. Again Victor explained to me as well at the owners what the process was and what to expect. They did this will minimum to no damage to the yard! When Victor was finished it looked like nothing had happened to my yard! I am draining free and clear! Super satisfied customer!

I live in Toluca Lake, CA and I heard about Fraser's Plumbing through a college mentor of mine. She was extremely adamate about me choosing Fraser's Plumbing as she has been utilizing their services for over 20 years.

I'd recommend this company to anyone.

On Sunday night I noticed that a pipe under my sink was leaking. As I live alone, it was pretty stressful.I called Mr. Speedy Plumbing first thing on Monday morning. I was impressed that they've sent a guy over to my house not only the same day, but literally in one hour. He fixed the pipe quickly and professionally. What I loved the most, however, was that the technician didn't leave any mess behind. No dirty floor.The price was extremely reasonable too. I was expecting to pay a lot more.I would recommend Mr. Speedy Plumbing to everyone who wants fast, professional and friendly service. Now I have a reliable plumber. Thanks.

These plumbers and electricians are the best! A few tend to brush them off because their prices aren't dirt cheap but thats because they get the job done right the first time! Mr. Cruz is not only experienced but honest as well. Everytime I have them do a job for me, he tells me what my cheapest options are and gives me various alternatives. He knows the building and safety/housing system inside out so he knows how to do all the work up to code. Trust me, dont waste your time with unlicensed cheap plumbers/electricians, get it done right with Joe Cruz!

I had busted shower handle that need to be replaced on Sunday morning. I called Mr. Rooter and within 15-20 minutes a plumbing tech (Tom M.) was at my door. He carried himself with great professionalism and explained my options, the issue ended up being a little tougher than I expected which would've been a nightmare if I would've tried to do it myself. Tom used his expertise and knocked it out in under an hour.  Thus is the second time using Mr. Rooter so I had to take the time to write a well deserved review for them.  I highly recommend them for your plumbing needs!!!

I love Jack Stephan plumbing! They have been my go-to plumber for my current home for 15 years. They have a great team, are honest, reliable and their prices are very reasonable. I have recommended them to several landlords in the past 40 years, who were as pleased with their work as I was.Rene, the plumber who came this time, was very knowledgeable. My problem was quite unique, but he figured out how to fix it at a reasonable rate, and in a timely manner. I would highly recommend them. I have never had a bad experience with Jack Stephan Plumbing, in all the years they have come to my home, not in any of the rentals, nor in my own home. They are a family-owned business who has been around a very long time. They are friendly, extremely easy to work with, and I feel very comfortable using them, as I know my problem will be fixed in a timely manner, will be done right, and at a reasonable price.

At about 10pm last night we had a nightmare sewage backup in our bathroom which overflowed into other parts of the house. I found Rooter Man Service online thru yelp from the great reviews and prices. It was late so I was worried we might not be able to get someone out to the house but to my surprise the phone was answered and I had a technician at my place within 45 minutes! He showed up and introduced himself very polite and knowledgable and very patient in uniform and all!  We had a million questions and Gary was so professional and put us at complete ease. He explained the problem and offered various solutions to fix it. He started with the most cost effective option which was to use a snake to open the sewer line. That was not effective so Gary called the office and within 30 minutes a truck with a trailer showed up with a hydrojet. These guys saved the day!  They offered a great referral for the water damage that we had so that we could salvage what was left of our bathroom.

Rooter Man Plumbing truly offers the BEST service compared to others. They are professional, honest and trustworthy! The prices estimated and actual costs incurred were amazingly affordable and accurate. My sister had a plumbing issue and previously contacted SEVERAL plumbers in her area, but the issue still persisted. A friend suggested we use Rooter-Man Once we called Rooter-Man Plumbing, the technician arrived within 35 minutes and was extremely nice and honest about the exact problem and explained to us in detail exactly what had to be done to resolve the issue. He was very knowledgeable and trustworthy! It has been over 3 months and there are no more leaks and no more headaches finally. They are the best in town and offer the most reasonable prices for their services. Our only regret was that we didn't call them sooner! If you want experienced professionals and the BEST service, don't waste your time or money elsewhere, call them, because they do the job and do it right the first time! THANK YOU Rooter-Man Plumbing!!! :)

I called in around 9pm on Thursday evening for drain cleaning and they were able to schedule someone to come out at 11 a.m. on Friday morning.  I was lucky enough to have Oscar come out to my residence.  This is the 2nd time Oscar comes out to assist and just as the first time, he was punctual, clean and very friendly.  Oscar was able to locate the problem right away and even was able to go under the house as he felt the problem was bigger than was visible.  He was able to point out the issues and provide an estimate.  After taking a look at the problem and having sewage come out of the pipes.  Oscar was able to run the snake and clear the pipes but he also cleaned the sewage mess which I appreciated tremendously. He did not pressure or do any hard sales but instead was able to correct the problem and provide an estimate for future repairs that needed to be done.  Excellent customer service, excellent work and Oscar is an great guy!  Kudos to Rooter Man Plumbing and Oscar!

Nothing But LIES from day one!! Do NOT waste your valuable time with this poor excuse for a law firm. They are only interested in settling a case not going to bat for you. Tony lied repeatedly to me then dropped my case His words were if you can find another attorney I will wave all fees, I did, it wasn’t easy because of Tony’s mess, and yet he had the audacity to petition the court for money and got it...He is a LiAR and a THIEF!! His incompetence in looking out for my best interest has Literally cost me my Life! Step up tony and be a man for once , return what’s NOT yours and interest....

Mr. Rahnama has always made time for me and returned my phone calls or emails in a timely manner. His office kept me up to date on what was going on with my case. If I had questions, they never made me feel like they were silly or something I should already know. They would also give me the worst scenario and the best. Therefore, I was never blind sided either way. Tony has been an excellent attorney.

I only refer them to my clients, friends and family.

Not only is this the golf course from *Swingers*, but it is a great way to blow an hour - and it is cheap.  The prices may have gone up recently, but a round used to cost $4 during the week; and club rental was - get this - $0.25.  They recently renovated the course as well so it should be even better!

You should be able to distinguish the way if a person is dressed I can see if you were pulling over a gang banger a gang banger or someone that looks as if they're trying to rob someone they have a white t shirt blue jeans or something good you were pulling over and stopping people that are dressed nicely wearing a shirt tie. you were police officer you should know how to distinguish simply by the way a person is dressed whether or not they're trying to commit a crime it's not as if the person was more during outside the person is dressed like they're looking dressed in all black dress with the t-shirt jeans like that stupid Yuri you need to be fired. Therefore you are very stupid and idiotic you need trainning and you need to be fired on the spot good bye

This company is a SHAM!  They said that they could have our 3 bedroom house packed up in 4 hours!  They came at 11am when're they were scheduled for 1. We had to tell them to come back at 1 when they were scheduled as we weren't ready.  At 12:30 we got a call saying they had a flat tire.  They finally showed up at 3pm saying they were tired and they could only move some furniture from 2 bedrooms and would have to finish the next day. Then said to pay in cash and said "it would be better to pay that way since Friday is pay day and I can just take the cash home to the misses instead of going into the office."  I told him we would be paying by card.  They ended up taking the truck to their lot and was going to unload in the morning because they were tired.  1 day tired to 3 days of HELL! They held our stuff for ransom till we paid in cash!  We had to call the cops!

WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE AND STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN MY $100 DEPOSIT CONFIRMATION BACK.  I booked for my daughter a small move of a small bedroom - small job maybe 4 hours - for a Sat morning  between 9-10AM.  We had to call 3 or 4 times to see where they were and when they were coming and were always told it will be in the next hour and half.  Finally at 3PM when we called - no one would answer their phone.  AT 530PM - the driver called and said he was on his way !!!!  We had already called another dependable moving company for the next day.Still have not recieved a phone call from them to apologize or refund my $100.  Do yourself and favor and do not book them......

San Diego Social Services, especially Joanna Huntsberger, are horrible people. God forbid your social worker has a quota to meet in adoptions. You will lose your child especially when people like Joanna huntsberger lie to you and tell you that the adoptive parents will never take your child away. However, in the LIE of open adoption that Joanna huntsberger told, 13 years later I am still without my son. Women like her are promoted for meeting their adoptive quotas, instead of reprimanded for lying to birthmothers. This is not a justice system. This is a system for social workers are taught to take babies. AKA legalized kidnapping. And Joanna huntsberger is one of the worst most underhanded comma and disgusting social workers that ever lived on the face of this planet. I would avoid social services at all costs.

So nice that anyone can utilize this pool facility. I was a bit hesitant because I thought it was hard to get into (that you had to reserve your day weeks or months in advance) but it really isn't that big a deal, especially if you go at mid-day when a lot of the morning crowd has dispersed. Yes, you'll still have to wait, but there's a whole beach to explore while you do!

Bought a motor home in Fresno, CA on 7/21/18. From the very first day that we picked it up, it was nothing but problems. It was even crashed while being on the dealership's grounds for repairs. We looked for different attorneys for 5 months. During that time, we mailed the dealership and the manufacturer many letters and got no response. We then paid for an attorney that was $750.00 just for them to write a letter to the dealership. Once the attorney did that, the dealership finally responded but with a negative result. We then found the offices of Jon Jacobs and gave them a call. The first person we talked to was miss Guisela. We were very surprised as to how she explained everything to us. She was very informative, friendly, and professional. Best of all, she spoke Spanish, as well as Shawn and Michael. Every time we had a question, they were very quick to answer. Our problem was resolved within 6 months. Our vehicle was bought back from the manufacturer and all expenses were returned to us. We were not charged a cent. This office deserves a 10 star rating. They have a great staff. We are very lucky to have found them. Now we believe that there are such attorneys that help out without charging.We appreciate them. Very well recommended.

Mike, Guisela, and the rest of the crew could not have been more helpful, professional, and pleasant. They made a not so fun situation much easier. I would highly recommend this office!

The law offices of Jon Jacobs was nothing less than outstanding during my lemon nightmare!They have great communication skills, always ensuring I was up to date on where the process was at.They ensured that I got the money I deserved from the manufacturer with little stress and within a very timely manner. I have no complaints at all. Everyone at the law offices of Jon Jacobs was always friendly and helpful whenever I needed . So if you have a lemon and are looking for a lawyer do yourself a favor and call the law office of Jon Jacobs.

I had the privilege of working with the office of Jon Jacobs, whom defended my case against Ford. In less he 8 months they were able to negotiate a buyback and got me a remarkable settlement. I highly recommend them, since I can guarantee that they will fight for your case and help you to obtain the best results they can, regarding your case. In a scale from 1-10 with 10 being excellent, I give them an 11! ☺ Yes, they will go above and beyond, exceeding your expectations. It is my opinion that Jon Jacobs and his wonderful group of people including Rene Dupart and Kayla Geottman deserve an A+++++++++!

I had heard of the law offices of Jon Jacobs in the past but when my mom and I had a real problem with her new RV I asked a friend who had recently had his Chevy truck bought back.  It was these guys that helped him and what a great job they did for us too.  This was one of the easiest things I have ever had to deal with minus the Jayco piece.  Thanks again Lemon Buy Back team, great job !!!!!

When I got in my car accident, I suffered from severe migraines and neck pain. I felt tired all the time and did not know where to turn. My friend who recently went through a similar situation suggested that I make an appointment with Robin at Hanasab & Associates as they helped her win her case quickly and efficiently. I was hesitant because my family has used the same lawyer for years, but my friend convinced me that I would not be disappointed. She was right. The second I walked into the Hanasab & Associates office, I knew I made the right choice. Their office had a welcoming and professional vibe which at first, made me think that they would not be affordable. However, when I met with Robin, I was surprised when I learned how quick and affordable my experience would be. Robin was organized, professional, and friendly. He really made me feel at ease, was thoughtful about my health, and seemed like he wanted to do everything he can to help me feel better soon and win the case as well. I could literally say that the whole experience was stress-free and I ended up winning my case. I would definitely work with Robin again.

Hanasab and Zolekhian law firm is a great Los Angeles accident attorneys. My daughter and I were involved in a very bad car accident and I was clueless on how to handle the situation on my own. It's very hard to find attorneys who allow you to contact them personally instead of you contacting their assistants. I was told that I didn't have a case because the hospital put a lien on my account. My attorneys proved different and I was able to file my case with the insurance company. The process was very quickly and I'm glad I selected H & Z law firm to take my case.

Personal injury expertise Hanasab and Zolekhian law firm is simply amazing! I was in a car accident and suffered greatly, from physical injuries and insurance claims, but Mr. Zolekhian and Mr. Hanasab helped me a lot and needless to say, I couldn't have done it without them.

Professional, knowledgeable and experienced representation. I was helpless and confused about my case until I met Mr. Robin and Mr. Raymond. They provided an excellent explanation of possible scenarios for my case and also the entire process. The responsiveness I got from Hanasab & Zolekhian law firm was very quick. They were supportive during my court hearings and had been instrumental in getting case dismissed. Last but not the least, the office environment is well kept and professional and their paralegals had been helpful in getting my doubts cleared. I am grateful for Mr. Robin Hanasab and Mr. Raymond Zolekhian for handling my case and helping to get it resolved. Highly recommended!!!!

Amazing Attorneys! I got into a car accident about 2 months ago, the person responsible refused to pay for the damages on my car and tried to pin the blame on me. lucky for me, my coworker referred Hanasab and Zolekhian law firm to me a while back. I gave it a call, and it was probably one of the smartest decisions I made in my life. The attorneys helped me a lot in getting the other guy to pay for all the damages done to my car and other expenses caused by the accident.

Mr. Hanasab and Mr. Zolekhian are great personal injury lawyers! My nephew got seriously injured in a truck accident and I had no idea what to do. I didn’t know whether to contact a truck accident lawyer or personal injury lawyer. The trucking company refused to take any responsibility of the accident and worse, the driver was let off after a small bail amount. This is when my close friends recommended me to get in touch with a personal injury attorney. Luckily, we contacted Hanasab & Zolekhian law firm. They provided all the legal help we needed. During trial, trucking company was found responsible for the accident and my nephew got compensation for the losses he suffered. It surely helped him to get his life back on the track again. I’ll definitely recommend Hanasab & Zolekhian Law Firm.

Mr. Hanasab and Mr. Zolekhian are dedicated attorneys to those in need! I was driving on a highway when I suddenly lost control of my car and crashed into the center divider. I suffered from minor injuries because of the incident. When I checked my car, I found out that my car's wheels have defects. I contacted the manufacturer immediately and reported what happened, but they refused to believe me. Good thing a friend of mine recommended me to Hanasab & Zolekhian law firm to handle my case. They helped me gather evidence to file charges against the manufacturer for a defective product. After several hearings, I eventually got the compensation I deserve, thank you, to Mr. Zolekhian and Mr Hanasab for all the support!

Mr. Hanasab and Mr. Zolekhian went out of their way to make sure that I got all that I deserved. I am so glad I came to these guys, and I highly recommend Hanasab and Zolekhian law firm!

I've been referring cases to Hanasab and Zolekhian Law Firm ever since they handled my car accident case a year ago. So far all my friends have good feedback and the staff are very polite. They gave me updates almost every week and whenever I ask to speak with Mr. Zolekhian or Mr. Hanasab to discuss my case, they have always accommodated me. They took legal action and obtained the benefits I deserved. Surely, they are compassionate and reliable attorneys. Again, thank you for taking our case and helping us through the process. You guys are the BEST!!!

We knew we had a very serious case involving multiple parties. We did quite a bit of research and met with few other attorneys. We decided to go with Mr. Hanasab and Mr. Zolekhian because they were experienced, smart, and articulate. They took a great deal of time explaining everything to us. They brought our case to a quick resolution with an outcome better than anything we expected. Mr. Hanasab and Mr. Zolekhian are the best and most dedicated attorneys I have ever met. Their dedication to their field of law are far beyond their competitors. I highly recommend them!

Hanasab & Zolekhian law firm was able to handle my auto accident claim in a very professional manner. I was involved in a car and ended up in the hospital for 5 days and I attempted to work with the at fault driver’s insurance company but started giving me the run-around on bills and was too much of a hassle to work with. Worst, I received a collection letter from the hospital. This is when I decided to look for a good personal injury attorneys online. Luckily, I found Hanasab and Zolekhian law firm and within 2 days we were already moving in the right direction. A week ago, I received the settlement check. This law firm obtained me a fair settlement! I’m so happy working with them! Great attorneys!!!

Mr. Kraut is the type of lawyer that you should want to keep on speed dial. He is very efficient and gets the job done promptly.

We never expected this case would take 11 months to resolve or that there'd be so many ups and downs, but Michael never gave up! He kept fighting, kept coming up with new ways to attack the case and expose the problems and get to the truth! He would not stop until we reached the resolution we desired!! Michael is incredibly good at what he does and even more so, he genuinely cares about his work and his clients!Thank you Michael for all of your hard work, your tenacity, you honesty and your endless pursuit of justice!! We are forever grateful!!

I was arrested for a felony and Michael told me that early intervention might make the difference. Michael was able to get the prosecution to only file a misdemeanor and my end result was beyond belief! No fine, record or jail time! I don’t know if there was a better outcome than that.. it’s hard to imagine that there is and more than happy I decided to trust Michael with my case!

I couldn't have found a better representative.  Michael made sure that I was properly guided trough the legal process and ensured that my case was professionally handled to the end.  I was in school full time in Norcal the time of my last appearance and he appeared for me so I didn't miss my final.  In the end, my case was reduced then eventually dismissed.  Michael is an amazing lawyer and person and recommend him indefinitely.  Thanks Michael!

Hands down Michael Kraut is the best criminal defense attorney in Los Angeles.I was in a really bad situation.  I was arrested on two outstanding warrants in November of 2012 out of the Burbank Courthouse, one for credit card fraud and one for harassing phone calls.    I made bail but it took almost three days before I was finally released.The offer on the table from the prosecutor's office was for a guilty plea and subsequent conviction on both counts, a total of 75 days jail time, and huge fines.I freaked out at the thought of going back to jail again and my professional career would certainly come to an abrupt end if I had one conviction on my record, let alone two.  I knew I was innocent and if I did not find a great attorney to fight these bogus criminal charges then my life was going to be totally ruined.  Things could not have been more stressful.And then I made the best decision I ever made in my life by hiring Michael Kraut.  Michael Kraut knows the Burbank courts inside and out.  He worked for the City Attorney's office for many years and personally knows the people who are sitting at the other side of the courtroom who will decide your fate.  He really has a commanding presence in the courtroom and everyone respects him and looks up to him.The results he achieved for my two criminal cases could not have been better.  Both counts have been dismissed, no fines, no jail time, my bail was exonerated, and I will not have a single conviction on my record.  I could not have asked for better results.Michael Kraut really does go above and beyond for his clients, and I can say that he pretty much saved my life as going to jail and having multiple convictions on my record would have been devastating to my personal life and my career.Hopefully, you will never need to hire an attorney but if do, do not hesitate to call Michael Kraut.  Hands down he is the best criminal defense lawyer out there and he is committed to get you the best possible outcome possible for your criminal case.

Stop researching.  Just read!!!!!  I just got a new job.  It was the last day at my old job and my coworkers took me out for a celebrational farewell.  On my way back home, I receive my 2nd DUI - a felony DUI for a traffic accident.  To make matters worse, I refused all chemical tests.  With a list of prior convictions, I was sure my life was over.  I was scared, frustrated, confused and stressed.  Like many of you, I have searched the internet endlessly to find a good attorney to represent me.  I was referred to few and have spoken and met with many more.  Then I came across Michael Kraut and Kraut Law Group on AVVO.  When I went to go see him I was a nervous wreck.  Like every attorney, he asked what my charges were and reviewed my papers.  Then, unlike any, he puts the papers down, looks me in eye and asks me how I'm doing (trust me I was surprised too).  We sat and talked for a long time.  Here it is.   He's attended Harvard Law School - he's very well educated.  For many years, he was a prosecutor (gang division) - enough said.  His network and connection is unparalleled (keep reading).  Within couple of weeks of hiring Michael, he had intervened with the police and prosecution and was able to get them to file my case as a misdemeanor DUI.  WHAT??  The City Attorney dropped the refusal and minimized every part of this case.This is magic - you can't make this up.  Next day I'm in court waiting.  Michael arrives.  We go inside the courtroom and he tells me to sit.  I sit.  He walks right up shakes everyone's hand and waits in line to grab my file.  He gets my file and walks right up to the prosecutor - court is in session and all the other attorneys are sitting down waiting for their case.  He looks at the judge and goes right up to the prosecutor.  They talk for a little and laugh for a little.  Afterwards, he turns around, looks at me, winks and smiles.  He talks to another prosecutor, then his assistant.  After, he extends his arm and motion me to come.  As I approach him, he shows me both hands and says "10 days".  10 days!!  He reduced my sentence from 30 days to 10 days on the day of my court!!!  All this in like 5 minutes!!!  Anyways, I thanked him and he ran off to go to Van Nuys for trial.  Confused, I asked his assistant to what just happened and he replied, "I've been working for him for over 2 years and I have no idea how he does it."  Never seen anything like it.  30 days jail, reduced to 10 days on the day of court!!!  Now the only thing left is my DMV hearing which is in couple weeks and I know Michael will fight to try to save my driver's license as well.I know there are many attorneys out there; however, you have the right to interview and choose an attorney to represent you in court.  However, you want an attorney that knows the law, have a good reputation and rapport with prosecutors and judges, proven results, sharp and is well connected.  For these reasons, I urge that you to place Michael Kraut on top of your list of attorneys to interview.

Best Result possible!Michael Kraut is a great lawyer and he made my problems go away.  I was arrested and falsely accused of conspiring to commit felony theft. Despite knowing I was completely innocent I couldn't help from completely freaking myself out. I knew I didn't have the money to defend myself if it came to trial and worried incessantly about being pressured into pleading to lesser charges, living with a record, and the possibility of jail. I couldn't eat, I couldn't work, I couldn't sleep. I started smoking again. I was a mess. I met with several lawyers and shopped around. A lawyer friend of the family who I trust very much recommended Michael Kraut as he was working with him on another case. I looked him up. His reviews were the best I had seen and I liked that he is a former D.A. After meeting with him, I hired him on the spot. Michael was able to get my case rejected before it ever reached the prosecutor's office and get my property returned --all without me ever having to tell my Mom what was going on.I would definitely recommend Michael Kraut to anyone who finds themselves in a similar situation.I'm happy to say I now sleep through the night, I've stopped smoking and I'm working on getting the arrest expunged all together.

Having a misdemeanor petty theft or felony theft conviction would have not only embarrassed me in front of family and friends, but could have jeopardized y professional license. I was so afraid and panicked at that possibility that I spent a sleepless night looking on line for the best criminal attorney to help even BEFORE charges were filed. I cannot describe the anxiety and stress I felt. By six am on a Sunday morning I could contain it no longer. Time to see if the reviews about Michael Kraut were sincere and true. I woke him up with that phone call, and with that and everything else that followed, I learned that the glowing reviews were accurate.  He answers his calls personally, he means it when he says he will work hard on your behalf to get the best possible outcome, and he really does care about his client. Mike intervened immediately and was able to "make this thing go away" with no charges filed. His experience allowed him to approach all parties involved in a way that minimized conflict and worked in my favor.  I owe a debt of gratitude to him for helping me with this.

How can I express how relieved and pleased I am with Michael's professional abilities to have my Felony down to a misdameanor to possible dismissal with deferment.  With his care my life has been turned around and cannot say how helpful he's been not only in my case but life.  He, himself has changed how I view criminal lawyers.  Thank you so much Michael!

A few months ago, my son was pulled over in Glendale, CA for having his headlight out and wound up being charged with a DUI.  We have never needed an attorney before and immediately started searching on the internet.  Because Mike Kraut was listed as being a former Deputy District Attorney in Los Angeles, we decided to call him right away.  We didn’t feel we had the time to shop around for attorneys and wanted to make sure we got the right person the first time.   After calling Mike the morning after the incident, he returned our call within a half hour and made time to meet us that afternoon.  He said the best thing we could have done was to contact him straight away while he still had an opportunity to handle the situation before charges were filled.  The most important thing Mike did was to calm us all down.  We were all seriously stressed out!  He laid out the situation for us in plain English, gave us his background and confirmed that he knew the Glendale system inside and out.  It turns out he even knew the arresting officer!  We knew we could not be in better hands and left the rest to him.   Of course, waiting is the hardest part of a situation such as this but we put our trust in Mike and he came through will flying colors.  After aprox 5 months... ALL CHARGES WERE REJECTED!!!   I’ve read though other reviews of Mr. Kraut and it’s obvious that his success rate is through the roof.  I can’t imagine anyone doing a better job.  His knowledge, expertise and bedside manor so to speak are perfection.   Anyone reading this in need of an attorney, please put your worries aside and call Mike Kraut NOW!!!  You will be very very glad you did!

I could give Michael 6 stars but there are only 5 available.  When I first walked into Michael's office, I was confident that I would not need to hire him -- I thought I could handle my restraining order defense case on my own.  After meeting Michael, and hearing his thoughts on my situation, I immediately realized that I was dealing with a professional.  With minimal effort on my part, Michael got me off.  He is an intellectual and strategic thinker who saved my reputation.  If, heaven forbid, I should find myself in trouble again, I will call Michael even before I call my wife.  You will be in good hands with him.

I was recently arrested for the first time in my life. Not knowing what to do or who to trust, I'd hired the first lawyer that I found online and he was doing nothing for me. In fact, I found out that he incriminated me and refused to work with the police investigator on my case. I quickly realized that I needed to get my act together and find a new lawyer. Determined to rigorously vet my potential replacement attorney, I visited Avvo.com and met with eight different high quality firms, many of which seemed very competent and determined to help me. However, Michael Kraut was the only one who seemed willing to go above and beyond. He told me to follow my instincts and hire the right lawyer for me. Well I did just that, hired him, and am so glad that I did. He was attentive and in control from the get go. He is a straight shooter, kept me up to date and personally answered my phone calls and emails. He was the best lawyer I could have asked for and got seven of my eight charges dropped. I faced serious life-long repercussions and, with Michael's help, ended up just having to serve 20 days of community service and one year of therapy. I truly believe that Michael was the only person who could have gotten this fantastic plea deal for me. Michael Kraut has integrity, grit, and a love for his job that is extremely rare. He is well respected and he shows others respect. Thank you Michael! I will never forget this!

How do you place a review of someone that literally saved your life and your family’s life? I met Mr. Mike Kraut in April of 2012.  I researched approximately 10 attorneys before hiring Mike. It was important to me to have a former District Attorney represent me, I felt that he would know the process better, he would know people, and he would be trusted inside the District Attorney’s Office as an honest and straight forward attorney. And as it turns out I was absolutely right, he knew everyone, and they all respected him. That was so important. I actually witnessed this, not heresay; I personally saw his relationships go to work for me.A criminal investigation was initiated against me by The Los Angeles District Attorneys Office for conversion of funds, misappropriation of funds and several other alleged charges, these potential charges could have led to multiple felony counts against me. Due to the nature of these charges and them being considered by the District Attorney’s office as financial crimes, white collar crime, I felt that only a former District Attorney would be effective for me. To say that I was scared to death would be an understatement, could not sleep, could not rest, this situation consumed my entire life for months. I would literally go off the deep end from time to time. I have a 4 year old son and at the time also had a 3 week old baby at home, the stress was UNREAL, but Mr. Kraut was always there for me, always able to put things back in prospective for me.  That’s another thing, Mike Kraut himself answers his phone, every time, not once through this 5 month process did he not personally answer his phone and take my call, EVERY CALL. I hired Mr. Kraut and he immediately contacted the DA’s office on my behalf and started arranging meetings and started relaying my side of the story to them, the way a former prosecutor would do. When you know the process and how it works, like he does, you would know how to relay the proper information. Mr. Kraut really got to know me, know my family, not just by my case, but took time to know me personally and know what I was about, versus just believing the horrendous allegations that were alleged against me. He cares, he cares about me, he cares about the outcome and he cares about his reputation.In closing, this man saved my life. It was a “White Collar” crime, financial crime, he took the bull by the horns from the very first day, just last week Mr. Kraut, myself and my wife had our final meeting, he had received a decision from the District Attorney’s Office, after a five month investigation no charges will be filed against me, the matter is closed and I am free of so much stress and can move forward with my future plans and enjoy my life and family. There was a time during this process that I would have bet MY SOUL that this would never be dismissed, I was CONVINCED, 100% that I was going to State Prison, Prison, that what I thought. In comes Mike Kraut, no charges, goodbye, have a great day, you are free to go. MIKE, UNREAL!!!!Please listen carefully, if you are in trouble, if you have a criminal issue, stop looking for an Attorney. Just Stop. Call Mike Kraut and he will take care of your matter. I promise you, I do not usually post reviews. I assure you, every word written above is the gospel truth, and this man is all that I say he is. He is awesome, honest, tentative, respected, diligent, caring and just an overall winner. I love Mike Kraut, I will have his number in my phone for the rest of my life. He is no longer my Attorney because he resolved all my matters, but he is something more to me, he is my friend. Thank you Mike Kraut I have no words that will ever justify how I feel about you, but thank you Mike, I owe you my life and I will forever be indebted to you.

I had Michael represent me in reducing a previous expunged felony charge to a misdemeanor about a year ago.  My charges were 10 years old and were supposed to have been dropped down to misdemeanors before expungement, but were not! The crime was a mistake committed when I was 18 years old and is definitely not who I am today.  My past was haunting me and not allowing me the employment opportunities that I very well deserved. Many attorneys stated that since the case was already expunged and closed, that there was nothing that could be done. Michael accepted the case despite its rarity and complexity of reopening. He was amazing! He was very straight forward, direct and easy to understand. Within weeks he was able to reopen and close my case with the correct charges at the El Monte Courthouse. I now have the opportunity to reach my dream of becoming a firefighter and giving back to the community. I would definitely go to Michael for any legal matters and recommend him to all that are in need.

On June 23, 2011, after side-swiping a parked SUV and leveling a stop sign, i was arrested and booked into the WONDERFUL Beverly Hills Jail (no joke- was comparable to a recent stay at the Beverly Hilton) on suspicion of DUI…for the second time. This would have been my second DUI charge, resulting in a large fine, 9 months of DUI class, community service, and possible jail time, had i not been blessed with meeting Attorney Michael Kraut. After my first and ONLY DUI (thanks to Michael), i realized i had a drinking problem and sought help. After a few months of being sober and an active AA member, i was accused of being under the influence of prescription meds while driving (Still a DUI), as they "found" my prescription bottles hidden on the cushion of passenger seat ;). I have since tapered off ALL my medications. As you can imagine, after working so very hard to get and maintain sobriety, and be booked for taking medications prescribed to me for anxiety, i was furious and very scared. After a quick online search, really good reviews, and a more than proficient understanding of DUI charges, i met Michael Kraut. He's a straight shooter. He will tell you the facts, inform you of all possibilities, but also assure you that he will make things better. AND BOY, CAN HE!!! As i and Mr. Kraut felt the charges were not valid, and should not be treated as a second offense, he stood by me for a YEAR! I didn't have to show up to court until the last day, but would get phone call updates on a regular basis, letting me know what he was working on and what they were trying. In the end, i ended up with a "Dry Wreckless Driving"  charge, a 3 month driving school (Half the time of a first DUI charge), no com. service, and no jail time. If i had to do it again (please, oh please, never, ever,ever…did i say ever? EVER again) i would choose Michael. Thank you, sir!

As a physician it was so painful to be charged with DUI. My professional life was in danger. After spending a night in the jail I was hopeless and helpless. Michael Kraut, is the man of his words. He said he is very honest and he was. He said he could help me and he did. He is as competent and efficient as he says. He made the impossible happen and rejected all the charges before the court day,  as if it never happened. When I re-applied for my driver license, I realized that DMV never got informed; they had no idea why I do not have my driver license. Medical Board also never got informed. I learned my lesson and I am back on my feet. Michael you are great and I owe you the rest of my professional life.

"Let's make this thing go away."     After an argument with my 94 year-old-father about taking his medications properly and his ability to drive safely, I was shocked to find myself arrested for elder abuse in the Bellflower area of California.   I was trying to keep him from harming himself with his medications and others with his car and within minutes I’m stripped of my possessions and locked behind bars!  Even though my family convinced him to drop the charges a few days later, the state refused to drop the case.  I am a health professional with a state-issued license to protect, so I needed an experienced attorney quite familiar with elder abuse cases .  My primary source of income was on the line.    Even though the case seemed absurd to me initially, when the state refused to drop it, things got scary and even more stressful.  I needed a good attorney.    I researched elder abuse law and elder abuse attorneys and came across Michael Kraut’s firm.  He definitely had the experience and his website was well organized and informative. Pick the wrong attorney,  and I could lose my license or even go to jail because I just wanted to help and care for my own father!  It was an awful feeling, probably the worst experience of my life. I called Mr. Kraut and he answered the call personally and he listened carefully to what I had to say.  I could tell from his questions, comments, and understanding that he would do a good job.    I met with Mr. Kraut and was impressed with the office, its location, and the way I was treated professionally.  He understood the seriousness and the mechanics of the case. He worked out a fee based on my ability to pay and went to work.  Since it was a misdemeanor case, Mr. Kraut appeared in court for me and had me call him after each court date for an update.  He answered the phone personally. He returned any other call or email promptly.   Mr. Kraut got my case dismissed.  I chose the right attorney for the job. I’m able to continue to practice, and would recommend Mr. Kraut to anybody who is in need of an outstanding attorney.

I’m now on the other side of what has been a horrific year and a half. I lost a career, my wife left me, but I still have my life. I thank God I was able to hire Mike. He did exactly what he promised he’d do; he got me the best outcome possible, and it was a far better one that could have hoped for. If you’re reading this right now and facing a similar situation, first of all, don’t give up. There is always hope. You will get through it. Secondly, you want someone going to bat for you who really cares about you as an individual, someone who sees you as a person and not just a case file. Mike will be with you every step of the way. I can’t speak highly enough of his skills. There are plenty of criminal defense attorneys out there, but the one you need is Michael Kraut.

Upon opening my DUI case with Kraut Law Group, I immediately felt a sense of security dealing with Attorney Micheal Kraut. As soon as we begun our first hearing he dove right in, asking plenty of questions, and he began to assess my situation. After hearing my story he provided me with the best possible options as well as his plans for my case. In his response, not only was he realistic with his foreseen outcomes of my case but he surpassed my expectations by ultimately fighting for and winning me my full dismissal (the best possible outcome). In my opinion Attorney Micheal Kraut and his firm saved my life, my record, as well as a great deal of finances that I would be obligated to pay if I had not chosen Kraut Law Group to represent me in my case. I am very thankful for their hard work, and would definitely recommend them to anyone dealing with a stressful case such as a DUI.

I was falsely charged with DUI in the City of Pasadena in late December 2011. Ever since then, it has been very stressful for my life since I had never dealt with DUI before in my entire life. I began the searching process. I went through different review websites to find attorneys. such as http://AVVO.com,http://martindale.com...etc. I have to say, it was very time consuming because there are a lot of DUI attorney's out there on the web, and it is very difficult to judge which one is better. Almost all of the websites made the attorney(s) sounded really professional, but how do you know if they are truly professional and knowledgeable or just an Advertisement? I called at least 8 attorney's offices and I highly recommend Michael Kraut, Esq. Attorney Michael Kraut is very different than other DUI attorney's that I had contacted with during this searching process. He would personally answer his call almost 24/7. I remembered the first time I called him was on a Saturday afternoon around 3pm, I was surprised that he answered the call himself. A lot of the other DUI attorney's office I called, they usually have an answering service to answer calls for the attorney, and then answering service will page the attorney, then the attorney will either call, email, or text you back. It is such a long process plus waiting time. Not only he answer the call, he was able to answer all the questions I have regarding DUI case. Michael Kraut also has a resourceful website that is very useful for anyone who has questions regarding DUI cases. I met with Attorney Michael Kraut later on that week following with the first call and he is really professional and well connected. I was glad that I found Attorney Michael Kraut. And the best of all is, I didn't have to go to jail, no DUI records, and no penalties. Life is not perfect sometimes, and if you happened to need a DUI attorney, Michael Kraut, esq. is your #1 choice! Highly recommended for his service. A+

I'm from Canada and didn't know I would be considered an immigrant like everyone else. But then my friend and old neighbor in Vancouver told me "what the heck are you doing?  We're not American. You need a visa to work!" hahaha I thought I could work for 90 days. So I went to see this law firm and ask questions like "can i work?" and the answer was no. =( boo. Anyway, luckly i had a job offer as a midlevel manager at a PC company and I applied for TN and got it! I'm much smarter now thanks to these guys. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! =D

As a manager of a well-known technology provider who hired this law firm, we needed to hire a foreign employee in marketing for our US branch. She needed of a work visa and permanent residency through our company. We hired this law firm based on our previous experiences and successes many years ago. This otherwise complex and difficult process was made much simpler and clearer by the attorney managing our case. Our results were excellent once more and our company is in gratitude for their professional services.

It happened fast and went perfectly. Thank you for everything.

I came across this immigration law firm while reading about visas for business owners. Not  that is matters but I wanted to open a new organic bakery in Los Angeles after doing so well overseas. It turns out a colleague of mine had hired this firm for his own papers and was running his own business as well in another city further south. Because it seemed like it was meant to be I went ahead and pulled the trigger. Mr. Kim at this firm helped me set up everything from the company papers to the immigration permits. Overall it took a couple months starting from scratch but it was all worth it. Lots of hard work put in from all side. I would recommend this firm to any business owner looking to do the same.

Very professional immigration law office with good staff. The lawyer helped me understand and answered all my questions. I came prepared with my school forms, passport and marriage certificate. After we started the application process, my job was to give them my personal info and they took care of the rest. The entire thing was very successful although I was a bit scared at first. After the government interview I officially became a resident with ALG's help. Thanks!

I have a lot of great things to say about this firm and its employees. Firstly they are extremely professional and friendly. But more importantly they know what they’re doing and they’re willing to go the extra mile for you especially when unexpected issues arise. It’s easy to become impatient sometimes when waiting for something important like your residency results. But it was reassuring to get answers and good ones when you need it. This law office was great at making sure things went right and for that reason I would recommend it to anyone. Thank you.

My case went very well here. I had a complicated situation dealing with a lot of legal problems relating to immigration. I don’t want to get into personal details but I didn’t think anyone could sort it out or even try to help me. I gave it a shot and decided to hire an immigration lawyer anyway. My lawyer wasn’t intimidated and was happy to help me. He saved me really. The key was to stay patient because the government has a lot of applications. I tracked my case online and to be honest I was worried sometimes. But everything got approved after about a year and it all worked out. Thank you!

I had to adjust status since my husband is a US citizen, but my case was a bit complicated so I was really worried. ALG made it so much easier for my husband and I.

I would definitely recommend them to anyone seeking immigration advice or services. Five stars well given!

I was referred to you after my automobile accident.That was the darkest time in my life. I was lost after the accident and a friend suggested that I talk to you. You and your staff were very supportive and knowledgeable. I have been a Registered Nurse for over 40 years but I did not know who to go to for help. Most doctors do not know how to treat patients' involved in an accident. You walked me through the first steps to healing and referred me to medical professionals who could meet my needs.Your referral of Dr. JOhnson was wonderful. As a healthcare professional, I believe I have a unique perspective on medical care. I felt I was given a first class work-up and physical therapy geared toward my pain and strength issues. His staff provided education and training on exercises geared toward pain relief and return to pre-accident strength. This allowed me to return to work. I was treated with dignity and compassion.You did much more than provide me with excellent medical referrals. You protected me from the assaults of the defendant's insurance company. It was quite an experience to see how the insurance company attacks the victim. I don't know what I would have done without you on my side. You anticipated their moves and I felt insulated from their machinations. I am awed by the settlement amount you negotiated for me.I wish everyone could have the benefit of you as his or her advocate. I pray for you and your family daily.

Remarkable service as always! I was on my way to work when I got rear-ended by another car. Luckily, I was only slightly injured but my car was badly damaged the rear bumper was detached and my tail lights were smashed and busted. I called up a friend for assistance and he came right up. He referred me to Emery Ledger - Personal Injury Attorney who immediately took up my case. In no time, I had my bruises taken care of and my car brought in to an auto shop for repair. It was truly remarkable, they are the best car accident lawyers in California!

I am so grateful to have hired Accident Attorneys Group! I would definitely recommend them to anyone that would need representation for a car accident. My Case Handler and his assistants always kept me updated and I received all the treatment I needed to feel better. Thank you do much for everything! It was all very appreciated.

Best guys in the business by far, used a different law firm (to remain unnamed) that dragged it out with no result. I was recommended to this law firm thru a friend who told to get in touch with Corey Higgins. Corey was very helpful and knowledgeable , he sat down with me and we went thru all points that were necessary so he would not be wasting my time or his before taking the case.What took another firm years with no result was solved by these guys in less than a year!And if they can't help you, they will be more than happy to guide you in the right direction.

I called car accident lawyers pros on my way home from work Sunday night after getting in a car accident and was directly connected to an attorney for free help. I just bought my car and someone pulled out of a parking lot, not looking.  Adam talked with me for over 20 minutes and walked me through everything I needed to know on how to deal with the insurance companies and getting my car fixed. Luckily I wasnt injured and didnt need to retain them, but not many companies will spend over 20 minutes helping you for free these days just to help, and i wanted to put a good word  for them because of it.

I could not ask for a more professional and comprehensive firm than Accident Attorney's Group.  From the moment I entered the office it was all about making sure that I was taken care of properly.  Bryan made sure all that I had to do was recover!  The paperwork, correspondence with the Insurance companies and all the necessary detailed legalities is extremely overwhelming when involved in an accident.  To have a knowledgable professional assume that task on my behalf was a miracle.  I am very impressed how proper and efficient information was processed.  I was kept informed immediately of any updates and status regarding my case. I Highly recommend Bryan and the Accident Attorney's Group.  Thanks so much for all of your help and assistance.

My Attorney was very professional and very understanding.  He kept me informed throughout the whole legal process. Him and his staff were punctual in returning my calls and answering all questions and concerns I had during the duration of my case. Although it was a long and enduring process, I was very pleased with the outcome and I highly recommend The Accident Attorney's Group.  Once again, thank you for your hard work and support in handling my case.

When I was sent to the hospital due to a vehicular accident, I don't know what to do. I don't know who to rely on this matter and how I should handle this situation. Obviously, it was a first for me and I have no experience when it comes personal injury cases.  It was not easy to find lawyer who would help me with my case. Many of those I contacted were either unresponsive or not interested in helping me with my case. Soon, I met Robert Koenig and I immediately understand that I have found the one. Right away, we discussed my situation and he came up with a defined strategy that would help me in getting the compensation I rightfully needed.

Finally trustworthy attorneys that focus more on their clients then on their personal pockets! I was injured in a car accident and my attorney helped me though the entire process. Not only was he extremely professional but he was also generally concerned for my health.  He made sure that I was seen by the best doctors and was not bullied around by the insurance companies. I definitely recommend this firm if you are looking for professional experts.   Thanks again for the outstanding service. -Isaac

I hired the Accident Attorneys Group, I had a serious accident and the insurance company did not want to pay for my injuries. Once they started my case, I didn't worry about a thing. My car was fixed. I went to a doctor who really helped me and I am feeling much better. The attorney was very patient and answered all my questions. He advised me to not take several low ball offers so we held out and got a really big settlement. I would advise anyone needing a great lawyer to hire them. This team is very professional and caring.

Attorney Jonathan Kwan is great. He is very friendly, but more importantly got the job done. My landlord refused to give me back my sizable security deposit after I moved out, but Mr. Kwan aggressively got it back for me. He kept me informed, and it felt great when I got all of my deposit returned.

I  recently was owed money from a previous employer. LA Legal Group came to the rescue and it was the most painless lawsuit experience ever, seriously. They're supposed to be long and drawn out and hairy and there's supposed to be frustration and waiting and anger... but no. This firm is great. They fight for you, do the research and you're almost completely hands off. All I needed to do was respond to their delightful Jonathan Kwan who was fast, professional and easy to work with and then open my mailbox for my retribution money. Beautiful.

The world of personal injury law is full of lawyers who don't necessarily bring to mind the most positive of things. I can say with 100% confidence that LA Legal Group breaks any negative preconceived notions one might have (and indeed broke mine). They are extremely professional and courteous and do genuinely care about the welfare of their clients. Not only that, these guys are successful and skilled in obtaining favorable results for their clients. I would not hesitate to have Jonathan Kwan at LA Legal Group represent me in a personal injury lawsuit, and you should choose them too if you want a law firm with integrity to help you.

I feel fortunate to have I found LA Legal Group to represent me in a landlord/tenant dispute that dragged on for 4 years. Attorney Jonathan Kwan was very knowledgeable, honest, hardworking, and informed us of the progress of our case every step of the way.During the process, Mr. Kwan was always reachable and his team is very organized and professional. He was a calming presence during a very stressful time and more importantly - we won! He is fair in all his dealings including pricing.Mr. Kwan will let you know if an approach or idea is unreasonable but he doesn't make you feel like an idiot. He is approachable, very knowledgeable and helps novices understand the system.I would use him again in a snap. Thanks LA Legal Group!

I filed chapter 7 bankruptcy with bankruptcy attorney Jonathan Kwan. He helped me keep my car and my house and represented me at the creditor meeting. All for $800 LESS than others lawyers. I no longer have to deal with creditors harassing me. Reachable, trustworthy lawyer.

A year or so ago I was looking to start my own business. After calling around to a few different lawyers, LA Legal Group was recommended to me by a client of mine. I definitely had a ridiculous amount of questions and I'm sure some were not the brightest! This was all so new to me!! Jonathan Kwan was the most helpful attorney and took his time to answer any questions that I had. He made me feel so incredibly comfortable. I ended up, after a bit of looking for my own, buying the business that I worked for for 12 years. Score! He helped me with everything from all the legal paperwork and licensing to the negotiations, to the signing of the final agreement. Yikes!! I truly truly recommend Jonathan Kwan from LA Legal Group if you want a lawyer who is honest and comfortable to talk with. And his prices are not so bad either!!

Jonathan Kwan is a great attorney with the highest professionalism.He walked me through the whole process easily and successfully.  He always returned my calls, and emails promptly.

Highly recommended! I was scared about filing for bankruptcy but the bankruptcy attorney here was really nice and talked me through what debts were dischargedable. I called a few places before  deciding to go here. They are by far the cheapest out there!  My chapter 7 bankruptcy was only $600 when other lawyers were asking $1,200+! He even represented me at the 341 meeting so i didnt have to answer to all those blood sucking creditors. Attorney jonathan Kwan always answered my phone calls and responded fast to my emails. It' so important to have a reachable bankruptcy attorney! His office is in central Los angeles, so very convienent for me. Plus, parking is free! A++!!

Jonathan Kwan worked on my case and did a great job.  He was honest and did all the things he told me he would do from the beginning.  I believe the hardest part of dealing with anything legal is trust with the person working with you.  I felt that.

Mr. Bergener is way better than anyone I've dealt with. I worked for a different personal injury attorney a long time ago. So friends still ask me about accidents or legal issues they have. My friend Samantha got into a car accident and wanted my help. So I helped her shop around and these guys seemed on top of their game and very knowledgeable. So I recommended them (and was a little bit nervous since it was entirely possible they just talked the talk but weren't really that great). I had no reason at all to worry. She was amazed at how competent they were and how smooth the whole process was. And it really made me look like I knew what I was doing. Bottom line: If a family member got in an accident, I would send them here.

My situation was extreme, having been hit by another car going 100 + MPH through a red light with no witnesses. Bergener and associates picked me up when I needed it moat and allowed me to focus on therapy and Recovery which Was Imperative To Picking up The Pieces And Getting Back To "LIFE". I DEFINITELY recommend you call them yourselves and discover the difference

We hired Mr. Bergener to represent us for a car accident in which my wife was injured (I was also a client). I expected that the process would require quite a bit extra effort for me -- and that I would have to chase down our lawyer so that my our case would progress smoothly. This was not the case. The firm handled everything and kept us constantly informed. The staff at the firm is very professional and we really enjoyed every interaction. My own claim with the firm, for loss of consortium resulting due to my wife's injuries, was handled very tactfully. Hopefully I never will need another lawyer, but if I do I certainly will use this firm again.

I was in an accident where I hit a driver who was turning left at a greenlight when he should have yielded. I called Jame's a few days later because I was having a lot of neck pain. They were able to find me many doctors in their network from L.A. to Victor Valley to treat my pain comfort needs. They covered ALL the bills! Their communication was top notch, along with their patients and well mannered staff! I had a good feeling about them! They exceeded their time frame and made sure that I understood all appropriations of payment!I couldnt be happier with the way they treated me! Thanks again!

Wow- what can I say about this incredible team? i was in an extremely scary car accident almost a year ago that required me to have extensive medical treatment on my neck and back, and Bergener & Associates were with me every step of the way. I worked specifically with Ryan Miller and Lehua Gardener, and they are true all stars. They found me the best medical treatment in LA, and made sure that I never paid a single dollar out of pocket to any doctor. The treatment was time consuming, and Ryan and Lehua kept close track of every expense and lost wages I incurred, and by the end of the process they fought for my health and pain & suffering, as well as negotiated my medical bills down to a fair price. In the end, Ryan got me an incredible settlement that provided me with financial security from everything I had gone through, and I have already been recommending this firm to anyone I know who has been involved in a personal injury car accident. Hopefully I won't need a lawyer again for a car accident, but if I do, Bergener & Associates has a lifelong client in me!

If you have been in an accident, do yourself a favor and call the attorneys at B and M.  I was rearended by a driver who was not supposed to be driving in the first place and sustained traumatic brain injury.

My accident was a little over a year ago,  I got rear ended by a little old lady, driving a huge Tacoma. I injured my neck. Didn't know who to call until my co-worker gave me Bergener Mirejovsky #. I was a little hesitant,  but I called. I got HELP IMMEDIATELY. 2 days later had my first interview,  everything was explained clearly and all my questions answered. The process lasted 15 months. I always recieved calls from Kloe giving me updates. Always very sweet and polite, very professional. I was informed of everything from the moment I had my first interview to the moment I recieved my settlement. I want to Thank all Bergener Mirejovsky team for helping me through this, it definitely made my life easier and I was able to focus on getting better from my injury. Thank you so much. God Bless you.

I came to Farid after an accident leaving school and as soon as we began speaking I knew he was the best attorney I was going to find. It was an absolutely amazing experience working with Mr. Yaghoubtil He and his staff made sure I was taken care of in every step along the way. I received constant updates of my case and in the end got a great settlement. As soon as you walk into his office you instantly feel welcomed. I would highly recommend everyone in need of a great attorney to come to him.

I was in a auto accident a few yrs back I was recommended to so many lawyers and interviewed so many. S.Cohen (Business lawyer) came to me as a referral and I hired Farid because he connected on a personal level he was very genuine. Farid didn't come on aggressive but he fought my case aggressively, he wasn't blowing smoke or promising things so I could sign with him. Farid was being him self and his actions spoke louder than words thanks for being my lawyer.

Daniel and his team are the nicest and hardworking group of individuals that I have met. They are knowledgeable when it comes to personal injury cases, auto accident and traffic cases. They treat their client with respect and work their hardest to help them with their cases. Another plus about this Law firm is that they all speak spanish.I would recommend Mr. Azizi to all my friends and family.

I was recently struck by a car going 40 mph while jogging in my neighborhood and lived, but not without injury. Thankfully, I knew Farid from his generous charity work in the community and called him to handle my case. He called me back immediately from his personal cell phone and stepped right in to handle the case. Farid is a true professional and has a huge heart. Not only did he work hard to get things done, he was always concerned about my well-being and healing process. He has many connections and made several  referrals to me during my recovery. I was able to connect with incredible doctors and therapists who were integral in my healing process.

Farid and his team are very professional and friendly, and I would definitely recommend them to anyone in need of a personal injury lawyer. Farid handled every aspect of my case efficiently. I was severely injured and unable to walk for several months, and he made the process as smooth as possible. Farid went above and beyond by coming to see me in the hospital and helping out with our rent as I was unable to work. Downtown LA Law was able to achieve the maximum amount for our settlement, including negotiating with health insurance and medical providers and even taking less for himself than initially agreed upon.

Ive had the pleasure to work w Farid on two separate occasions and he is fantastic. Not only was he efficient but is his timely and friendly responses was very much appreciated.

Thanks Again for Everything!

I can't overstate how happy I that I worked with Sal and Farid. I met/spoke with several attorneys before I met and decided to work with him. It wasn't until I met Downtown LA Law Group. Farid  gave me nothing but a positive experience during a difficult time in my life.

Farid was very patient with me because I am very stubborn I probably wasn't the greatest client but he stayed patient with me and helped me out on several occasions. After all the waiting I can say he definitely looked out for me and my end result exceeded what I thought. If you ever want a lawyer you can talk to about anything Farid is your guy. God has definitely sent him from heaven. He assisted me so well and went thru all the steps of my car accident case. He was reasonable with his pricing and was super patient. He was always available via text and email. It was awesome working with him I truly can't recommend someone anymore. I truly appreciate him and his time.

I've been working with this office for a few years now. They are professional, responsive, and fair. Daniel is willing to put in extra time and effort to make sure you're happy. Don't waste time with a other LA-based attorneys who will probably assign a paralegal to you once you retain their firm.

Wonderful outcome! Not exactly sure how Michael did it, but he did it, and with grace. I was the victim in a t-bone car accident which totaled my brand new vehicle. Everything that could go wrong went wrong. The police report was incorrect, and much of my hope was lost because the insurance company refused to accept liability. Michael got me a settlement, as well as connected me to some of the best orthopedic treatment which resulted in a settlement in less than 9 months. Completely avoiding trial. I highly recommend this firm to anyone facing a seemingly impossible to win personal injury case. To add to the benefits, his legal assistance staff are some of the most professional, thorough, friendly and efficient employees I have ever engaged with, and they definitely helped counsel and guide me through my difficult case. Sincere thank you to Ehline Law Firm.

Finding a good lawyer in Los Angeles is very hard. I have heard so many horror stories on cases only gone worse because the lawyer does not really have your best interests at heart.That is why I am taking the time to write a review about Roozy Saviss. He is amazing at what he does, he knows his stuff, very knowledgeable. Most importantly he genuinely cares about you, the client! Mr. Saviss was always on top of my case from day one until the day it was all settled. If I called and left a message or sent an email, he was always prompt in his response. I sincerely appreciate all of his work and with all his help I was able to have the best results as possible. I recommend him to all my friends and family because when you have Roozy Saviss representing you, you are truly in good hands! Too bad, Allstate Insurance already took that line, it should be Roozy Saviss' slogan!

I was reffered to The koohanim law firm team as I was looking for a good attorney to bring a case I had to a closure. The team is caring and Matt Koohanim is a really knowledgeable attorney. In the matter of a month, the case was dismissed and I could not be happier.

After an accident with 2 other cars in the 110 freeway, I was lost as my insurance was playing games and didn't accept the case.

Hit and run is never fun. After being hit while driving I pulled over and saw the car that hit me pulling to the side too. Everything happened too fast and I looked at my brand new car now missing the rear bumper :(as soon as I turned my head the other car quickly drove off and before I get a chance to get his info he was out of sight. I then felt a sharp pain in my back and had to visit the emergency room. I visited Matt Koohanim and he was helpful all the way around. He helped settle the bills with my dr. and got some payment from the the insurance.

I was referred to Koohanim Law Firm by a friend who only had wonderful things to say.  She handled my case with the great care and professionalism.  Matt was very responsive, and was easy to talk to you. He is very knowledgeable and . Most of the back and forth was handled through the office staff. (thanks Stephanie) . The whole experience was easy and painless.

Matt is one of those real lawyers.  In a DUI case we were referred to him and his team and him did their magic. I was terrified of the outcome and wasn't sure what would happen as I drive A LOT. So yea I regret what happened and was willing to pay the consequences but I still had to feed my family. Matt explained the process really well and basically the end results worked out well. I was able to easily get a hold of him and he returned my calls fast.  Great guy . I recommend him.

Dmitry and Elon are the best. I could not sleep nights until I met them and got them under contract. They brought me true peace of mind and assured me of my freedom. I was probably over reacting but still. Honestly, who likes to go to court? If you do though, however, be sure to contact Dmitry and Elon.

I just started working with Robin a few weeks ago.  I had a car accident and thus far, he's done a great job getting my life back in order.  He has been very responsive with all of my questions.  I'll let you all know how it turns out, but I'm very satisfied so far.

I was in a lot of back pain from my accident and feeling overwhelmed by the entire situation. I was very concerned and uncertain about my rights and who was going to pay for my medical bills. The pain was immense and it was getting the run around from the insurance companies. I tried to seek advice from my friend and she told me about her great experience with Hanasab & Zolekhian, LLP. Mr. Zolekhian was very attentive to my needs, he gave me guidance on what steps to take next to ensure that I would be taken care of medically and financially. I’m so thankful for Hanasab & Zolekhian and would highly recommend them.

I couldn't have asked for a easier process. These lawyers actually care and are trying to help you. Even better, they don't charge you a dime until you have a settlement! They were so helpful and knowledgeable. Thank you Ray and Ivette! I couldn't be happier with my experience!!
 -

Mr. Hanasab & Mr. Zolekhian are great Attorneys! Their law firm has been very helpful to me. I did not have any money but because I was assured that I did not have to pay for anything until I won, I really did not have anything to lose. Few months after, I finally got the settlement money and it was way more than what I had expected. I highly believe that you will not be disappointed if you hire the personal injury firm of Hanasab & Zolekhian if you have been injured. They really know what they are doing!

Robin and Raymond provide excellent guidance in difficult matters and are very supportive. Their advice and counsel were very educational, practical and savvy. They know how to follow the system and work the system with speed and effectiveness. We were delighted they got the outcome we deserved and needed. In addition, they were extremely responsive to phone calls or emails and always did what they said they would do. No need to check on Robin and Raymond, they are one step ahead of you. I am one very happy client!

Hanasab and Zolekhian law firm handled my issue very well. Mr. Raymond has a fantastic understanding of car accident issues and negotiated the ‘sometimes’ tricky language of an insurance policy. I recommended everyone to call him if you have uninsured motorist coverage and are hit by an uninsured driver. Mr. Raymond and Mr. Robin were able to take care the problems, and treated me with respect and courtesy.

My family and I are extremely grateful for the kindness and understanding that Hanasab & Zolekhian law firm showed us during a traumatic time in our lives. They were very professional and very knowledgeable. They led us through a very difficult time. I was impressed with the way they communicated with me and the fact that they were always available. I would recommend Mr. Zolekhian and Mr. Hanasab to anyone with injury cases. You will never regret working with them!

I contacted Mr. Zolekhian because of a very sensitive matter during a turbulent time in my life and I cannot express the level of comfort and protection he provided me. During a time when I felt lost and helpless, he provided me with the security and legal representation I needed to get through a tough time. I feel blessed to have worked with this law firm and I truly appreciate their tireless effort to get me justice. Although I could never feel whole, Mr. Zolekhian made me feel like I did everything I could.

My experience with Mr. Hanasab and Mr. Zolekhian was extremely pleasant and professional. They handled my case with personal care to make sure I was treated fairly and had the best possible settlement. They responded to my calls and kept me up to date with my case, instead of me having to chase them. I highly recommend Hanasab and Zolekhian law firm for any legal issues you may have!

Bought a motor home in Fresno, CA on 7/21/18. From the very first day that we picked it up, it was nothing but problems. It was even crashed while being on the dealership's grounds for repairs. We looked for different attorneys for 5 months. During that time, we mailed the dealership and the manufacturer many letters and got no response. We then paid for an attorney that was $750.00 just for them to write a letter to the dealership. Once the attorney did that, the dealership finally responded but with a negative result. We then found the offices of Jon Jacobs and gave them a call. The first person we talked to was miss Guisela. We were very surprised as to how she explained everything to us. She was very informative, friendly, and professional. Best of all, she spoke Spanish, as well as Shawn and Michael. Every time we had a question, they were very quick to answer. Our problem was resolved within 6 months. Our vehicle was bought back from the manufacturer and all expenses were returned to us. We were not charged a cent. This office deserves a 10 star rating. They have a great staff. We are very lucky to have found them. Now we believe that there are such attorneys that help out without charging.We appreciate them. Very well recommended.

Mike, Guisela, and the rest of the crew could not have been more helpful, professional, and pleasant. They made a not so fun situation much easier. I would highly recommend this office!

The law offices of Jon Jacobs was nothing less than outstanding during my lemon nightmare!They have great communication skills, always ensuring I was up to date on where the process was at.They ensured that I got the money I deserved from the manufacturer with little stress and within a very timely manner. I have no complaints at all. Everyone at the law offices of Jon Jacobs was always friendly and helpful whenever I needed . So if you have a lemon and are looking for a lawyer do yourself a favor and call the law office of Jon Jacobs.

I had the privilege of working with the office of Jon Jacobs, whom defended my case against Ford. In less he 8 months they were able to negotiate a buyback and got me a remarkable settlement. I highly recommend them, since I can guarantee that they will fight for your case and help you to obtain the best results they can, regarding your case. In a scale from 1-10 with 10 being excellent, I give them an 11! ☺ Yes, they will go above and beyond, exceeding your expectations. It is my opinion that Jon Jacobs and his wonderful group of people including Rene Dupart and Kayla Geottman deserve an A+++++++++!

I had heard of the law offices of Jon Jacobs in the past but when my mom and I had a real problem with her new RV I asked a friend who had recently had his Chevy truck bought back.

We needed an immigration attorney  to help us apply for an adjustment of status based on marriage. We initially approached Curtis Pierce after researching immigration attorneys on the internet. Our main reasons were that he appeared to have many satisfied clients and we didn't want a big firm because we were looking for a firm that would be able to provide more personalized services. We found him to be very professional, highly experienced and we appreciated his attention to detail. We particularly appreciated that he was easy to get a hold of, available to discuss our concerns and patient enough to answer our questions. Whenever we contacted the firm, we got prompt responses. If we sent an email, we'd get prompt replies; once we sent an email late at night and we still got a reply that same evening. They always followed up to make sure everything was on track and always kept us informed of relevant developments. Our adjustment of status was approved and we received the green card about 4 months after we submitted our application. If you need an immigration attorney, we highly recommend that you talk to Curtis Pierce.

I am from the UK and have had various immigration lawyers over the past few years for work visas. I decided to use Curtis Pierce for my green card application. I am pleased to report that the process was successful and by far the best experience I have had with any attorney. He was always there to answer any questions or concerns and his staff was equally helpful. I would recommend Curtis to anyone, friends and family included

I had a pretty complicated case and Mr. Pierce came highly recommended by another lawyer to handle my immigration problems. I was very pleased with the outcome and feel so much relief for having my case resolved. I no longer have to worry about travelling or being on edge about my status in this country and can now move on with my life.   I can finally relax. Thank you to Mr. Pierce for this job well done.
 -

 - 
I used Curtis on an H-1B application and can honestly say that he goes above and beyond the call of duty to get the job done.  He studied my case and worked hard to get the application as complete and solid as possible.  He addressed all my concerns with patience and clear responses and got things moving at his own expense. When it was all over, I got my H-1B approved and his professional knowledge of the law and USCIS processes played a decisive role. I recommend Curtis for anyone looking for a professional to handle any immigration issue.  He is not only knowledgeable but also a good person.

Mr. Hekmat is the best in the business!! Joseph has been amazing to work with! We met with a few other lawyers but ultimately felt the most comfortable with Joseph.  He is a very thorough, knowledgeable, and above all- caring person.  Mr. Hekmat was very good about keeping everything in perspective for us but also encouraging when the process became tough and emotionally draining.  Joseph is the kind of person who you want in your corner and is willing to give it his all to help make what's right- right.  Anyone looking to procure his services would be in very good hands!  He is an EXCELLENT attorney.

Our business needs experience and results. Especially at tax time. We are not concerned with anger and rants of pop music fans. Rothman's firm has the experience with US Tax Court that makes it our “go to” representation.

The list of clients that the Law Offices of Barry K Rothman represents is impressive to say the least. They are some of the giants and ground breaking artists of modern music and entertainment.  If Attorney Rothman is good enough to represent them he is clearly an exceptional attorney.

I refer all my friends and family to her.

I've worked with Hasti two years now, and she's hands down the best lawyer I have ever worked with. She's someone you could trust and share my non-legal ideas and thoughts with (and without being billed for being a friend...something that most other lawyers fail at). She's a delight to hang out with socially but professional and efficient when she needs to be. I cannot give a higher recommendation. Work with her. You can't go wrong.

This is a response to Ms W's defamatory, false and libelous  review of my law firm. Ms. W has never been to my office. Statements in her review regarding my personality and my law office are totally false and groundless. Over the past 20 years I have consulted and represented thousands of individuals in bankruptcy cases. I understand the stress and financial burden that my clients are suffering and therefore I treat my clients with utmost respect, empathy, understanding and care. Ms. W's review is instigated by an attorney competitor in attempts to cause damage to the immaculate reputation of my law practice. Ms. W had placed the same exact negative false review on Yelp, which was successfully removed after I informed Yelp support department.I am presently in the process of bringing action in the court of law for libel,  against the attorney who is behind these malicious, defamatory  and false reviews.Jasmine Firooz

I contacted Bankruptcy Law Firm of Jasmine Firooz since I had lost my job and was unable to continue to pay my credit card debts.

My physical and mental health was being affected under the stress of my financial situation. Jasmine sat down with me and patiently reviewed my finances. She explained to me how the bankruptcy process worked, and it became clear to me that filing for bankruptcy was the best option for my situation. She was with me every step of the way during the course of my bankruptcy until I received my order of discharge from the court.

We knew nothing about Ch 13 until the Ure Law Firm recommended this path of reorganization. The lawyers Tom Ure & David Shevitz did an expert job in getting our plan certified. As a result this is the first year in a long time that we have not had to use credit to pay our annual federal income and state property taxes. The plan is working and we can now see light at the end of the tunnel.

i was represented by Mr. Canter a few years ago. He was able to settle my case and i continue to work for the same company. He got me future medical care for life and i feel lucky to have found him.  His staff was always available to take my calls and if not, they would call me back the very next day. i have read some complaints of other people with bad experiences with lawyers but i guess i was the fortunate one. i would recommend him and his staff. I continue to call them now, whenever i need help getting my medical treatment authorized and they still communicate with me.

Mr. Canter handled my case for approx. 2 years and i was extremely happy with his services and his staff. If you are client looking to always have your attorney in his office, there has to be something wrong. Yes, he is in Court most of the time, but what can you expect from an Attorney? He does have excellent staff and if he does not call me back, they always call me. I was very satisfied with his services and have referred him other friends and family and  they all have great things to say about him and his office. I would recommend him anytime (already have done it)

Century City Flower Market is absolutely the best thing that ever happened during my wedding planning. Thanks to Annette and her team my very favorite detail of the day was the flowers and decorations they have created! After our first meeting, I felt very confident in her ability to provide what I was looking for. She really spent a lot of time working with me to ensure she could provide what I wanted and constantly followed up with me via email about budget and flower options. I had a great time working with her. It was actually really fun! I could cry with appreciation. I am so touched by the care, the personalization, and the beauty Annette brought to our church and reception space.I intend on telling every single bride-to-be about Annette and I vow to not let a single event that I organize go without Annette's floral design.

Wow! Thats all I have to say about this flower shop. It is amazing. The people are so friendly and I love every single flower arrangment they send. I always go to their store just to buy little gifts for my friends. They have an amazing assortment from candles to plants. Whenever I send flowers to my friends or family, they ALWAYS call me and tell me how beautiful they are. I just  can't even imagine ever going to another flower shop than this one. I highly reccomend this store.

I like to send flowers to my mother every once and a while just to tell her that I love her. Her husband died a few years ago and she's pretty much all alone. She keeps telling me that she thinks no one loves her anymore, which breaks my heart. Whenever I send her flower from Century City Flower Mart, she calls me and tells me how beautiful they are and how much happier she is when their in her house. She tells me that she feels loved. I want to thank them for making not only my mothers flower arrangments beautiful but for making beautiful flowers to everyone I send them to. THANK YOU!! I can't wait until they make my daughters wedding flowers.

I was searching for a perfect flower shop in LA that I could send my wife flowers from. She has specific flowers that she loves and their quite exotic. When I called other flower shops and asked if they had that flower, they said that they didn't and they also didn't make any effort to try to get them. When I was about to give up, I called Century City Flower Mart and they said that they didnt have any of those flowers that day, but they said that they could get them by the next day. I ordered flowers from them and by the next day they were delivered to my wife's work and she told me that all of the women were jealous and that she loved them so much.A week after I sent them to her, they were still fresh and beautiful. What I loved most about this flower shop is that they were friendly and they made an effort. I am positive that this flower shop will be my flower shop for life.

I love this shop!  They are the kindest, nicest and most talented people I know.  I have very picky flower people in my life and they are always raving about the flowers I send them.  I've even have them send me flowers on a weekly basis, they are exceptional and they last so long!I have used other flower shops before and have never felt so safe about ordering my floral gift that not only makes my friends and family happy, but blows them away!

I have used this shop for flowers for friends, acquaintances, and my husband's clients many, many times, and each time, the recipient has been almost speechless over the quality and beauty of the arrangements. The flowers the shop sent to a friend in the hospital were apparently (I didn't get a chance to see them) so gorgeous that three people who saw them started using the shop themselves! I can't afford exorbitant prices, but I tell them what I can afford, and the price is always exactly what they quote me.

Mann Grauman's Chinese Theater is a landmark that's kept the Walk of Fame alive in Hollywood. Although it's sad to see it engulfed by the overly bland Hollywood &amp; Highland complex, the theater is old-school Tinseltown all the way.  Don't expect stadium-style seats. Remember, it's an historic landmark.

This is the famous Chinese Theater that is in the heart of Hollywood.  I saw Zombieland here and in the movie you actually see this theater, which was cool.  The atmosphere is nice as it's an ornate theater, not your standard theater decor.

I saw 'A Serious Man' at the Arclight Cinerama Dome and it was a great experience.  The things that set this theater apart:1. Geodesic Dome 2. Employee comes out before movie and introduces it to the audience.3. Reserved Seating

I usually dread going anywhere in Hollywood, but I'll make an exception for this cinema, since the parking structure makes it pretty easy to negotiate. I like perusing their little gift shop while waiting for a movie to start (or you can go to the bar and have a cocktail!) They have lots of screens and showtimes to choose from, and typically feature costumes from current movies on display in the lobby.

Hands-down my favorite movie theater in Los Angeles. My only beef is they don't screen Pixar or Disney films. Otherwise, I see all my movies here. They have plenty of screens so catching a new release isn't that hard. Super clean theaters with nice comfy seats and since I'm tall I appreciate the steep arrangement or rows. I don't have to worry about people behind me! They also feature adult-only screenings allowing you to take your cocktails, wine and beer from the restaurant bar.

It's really true. I thought their prices were getting too high, but then I went to another theater and realized how mediocre the quality of the sound system, screen and seating was. Besides, you have to sit through almost half an hour of commercials.

This is my favorite place to see a movie.  It's the most well run theater in town.  The staff is well trained, the theaters are always clean, and since you can buy your tickets on line, it'e easy to get in and out.  Finally, you never have to worry about sound or picture quality - it's always perfect.

I've only been to the theater what and it was such a spectacular show it's only a once-in-a-lifetime experience I'll never forget it and I have not seen a show like that since and the theater was just in such great condition and fit with all the shows that were performed the atmosphere was awesome this was in 1987 we want this show to see the gypsies from Spain Flamingo Pluto I enjoyed it so much my Palms are hurting the next day it was so many standing ovations it happened all through the night I got a hoarse throat I wise whistling and yelling and last but not least I think the wine help the situation I hope that someone can enjoy that night the way I did and I hope to see you tonight for all...............

The El Capitan (owned by Disney) is a great place to see to see disney features.  With kids movies, they will often have a live stage show before the feature.  It is a big, glamorous, historic theaterwith easy access to the red line!

This place really does have an historic feel.  The theatre itself has so much detail everywhere you look and has just a magical feel. I came here recently to see Nightmare Before Christmas in 4D and was thoroughly impressed.  The organ player before the movie was amazing. Would highly recommend coming here for any movie because it makes the movie going process an entire event.

I've always loved this theater.  It's the perfect place to see classic movies that deserve more than a screening in my living room, where i know i'm going to fall asleep.When I used to live down the street I'd always make a point of walking down to catch great films like Citizen Kane, Lolita and On the Waterfront and I never really minded that the seats were a little beat down because the prices were cheap and the popcorn was good...But now the place is even better, Quentin Tarantino bought it, put in new seats, shows great grindhouse films as well as old classics while keeping the prices and the popcorn the same!

This was my film school.  The seats have seen better days but that's part of the charm. Be sure to check their calendar for special events and programmes. This is for real film fans. The ticket prices are great as there are many double features. Some people might get freaked out by the old school anologue aesthetic but I love it.

This might not be the most state-of-the-art theater, but what it lacks in comfort (and multiple screens), it makes up for in panache. Cool retro interior and the guy taking your tickets typically dresses in costume to match the theme of the movie, which is what I call going the extra mile. A special neighborhood spot.

This is what going to the movies used to be like. LOTS of legroom, and a theater designed to look like King Tut's tomb - cool! But you get the best of the modern world with a superior sound system and newer 'lounge' chairs with cup holders. Honestly, I want to see every movie here.

The Vista was once of the one great theaters in north-central L.A.  It's one of those old movie houses with carved figures on the walls and art deco engravings on the ceilings, etc.About 10 years ago, the Vista was refurbished and it is an amazing place to see a movie.  A big screen and new seats are a big plus.  The high ceilings with new paint and polished sculptures give the place a classic style that you just don't see in movie theaters anymore.Also, there is plenty of room to stretch out.  I am just over 6' tall, so I'm usually cramped in movie theaters.  In this theater, you can literally stretch out completely.  It's unreal how much leg space you have.  There is no other theater like this, and watching movies can be a relaxing, comfortable experience without added expense like you get with the Arclight and other "specialty" theaters like that.Stereo sound, etc. too.

This is the story of one good-sized screen and a couple of, well, smaller screens. (It is conceiveable that some persons may indeed have a larger viewing screen at home I suppose.) As other reviewers have noted, it's quite acceptable to see smaller films here in the mini-cinemas, but a poor choice for more grand scale films (unless shown in the Main auditorium.) I much prefer their sister theater, the fabulous Vista, but I will continue to patronize the Los Feliz Theater as well if there's something I wish to see. The matinee's a good deal, you can eat right in the area,(Palermos!! (:    and even visit Skylight Books after the movie. It all adds up to a nice experience, and I'm glad this theater is there.

you get what you pay for, I mean you don't expect an AMC kind of place for payin $6 fee..it's a steal really. were there to watch a movie for an hour or two not sleep on the floor and a have a picnic. the dirtyness of the seats kinda bothered me tho, expect to get bed bugs out of them. it's the perfect place to watch movies if ur in a big budget. I wouldn't come here all the time tho, the neighborhood seems sketchy and ghetto at night. so keep a look out if ur plannin of watchin movies at night. me and friends made a little joke cause there's this one dude inside that seems to incharge of everything, sells popcorn,tickets, open the front door, turn on the projector..hes either the owner or the only guy workin  there lol. overall I give it a 3 out of 5.

Nice price for new movies. Don't care for 3D movie's the only problem is the men that are saleing the tickets they are not nice they are mean the guys that are in the snack bar are always looking sad and very quiet they don't smile or are friendly that is very sad but one thing that is not going to stop me from taking my FAMILIA.

I take my dog for a day care here. The staff is super nice. They remember each dog's name and personality (?) so well. It's not so easy, because this place is so popular and I think they have at least 100 dogs every day - small and large. I check my dog on web cam sometime, when I have a chance. It's a great place.

Thank you Waggville! Pickle always comes home happy and tired after going to your doggy daycare. I really feel like he makes so much progress just being around your extremely friendly and professional staff. I regret not doing basic obedience at Waggville. We might be moving soon, but if it is put off, I most definitely will be signing him up ASAP for classes with you guys. Thank you so much for being such being such a wonderful place for Pickle. :)

My 4 1/2 pound yorkie, "Sophie" goes to Wagville a couple of hours a week purely for socialization.  For the first couple of times she sat in one place and stayed there for the entire time.  I could see she was being checked on, I called and they reassured me, even bringing her close to the webcam so I could see her.  Well after about 8 visits, she still sits calmly by herself, but that alone is a huge change.  Before, she didn't even want to be near other dogs.  One day I went there and one of the staff put her with another very small dog.  It was the first time I ever saw her play with another dog.  She was sooooooo happy.  Now, they are starting a brand new play day specifically for dogs under 8 pounds.  The first one starts on June 29th.  Every day I see her confidence show a little more.  I cannot be more grateful to the staff of Wagville who are making my little dog be as big a dog as she can be!  Thanks Wagville, great job!

I was told by another terrier owner that Wagville was the only place to go for extraordinary grooming and customer service. They were more than correct. My Airedale terrier, Naga, and I were treated royally by owner Julie and her staff, and Todd, the best groomer I have experienced. Having just moved to LA from Hawaii 3months ago this place has been my best experience settling in hands(paws) down. I look forward to being a customer for supplies and daycare in addition to grooming, and will gladly recommend them to all dog owners who want  and appreciate the best for their family member pet.

I had a great experience at Wagville! Not only is Wagville cage-free, but they are so attentive. I've never seen another shelter where the dogs have an actual person playing with your dogs the WHOLE time during their stay. I left both my boxers at Wagville for a 3-day weekend and never once worried about them.  When I picked them up, Wagville gave me a summary of what the dogs did while I was away, how the interacted with the other dogs, and they even gave me a picture of them to take home as a souvenir. They even have a web-cam so you can see for yourself how well your dog is being treated.

I MISS YOU WAGVILLE (oh, and so does my dog, lol). By far one of the best doggie daycares in Southern California... REASON: Because I just moved and I'm having an incredibly difficult time finding a doggie daycare with even half the benefits as Wagville. So much so, that I'm spending my precious Monday evening writing my first review on this site in the first place. Hands down... I've learned through my research downtown and the westside that Wagville has a wonderful reputation, and rightfully so. There is so much drama in downtown Los Angeles, and who would have thought it would concern "doggie daycare" drama ... yup!

After reading all the great reviews, I decided to bring my dog Dallas here while I went away for the weekend. We had a great experience. The staff was friendly and reassuring, and the webcam is a great touch! I liked being able to check on him throughout the day, and he always seemed happy and well taken care of. The place is clean, and the staff seems to genuinely care about the well being of every pet that is there. Fantastic place to take your dog for grooming or boarding!

The service and staff has and will go above and beyond to help you with your dogs needs. From the front desk staff to the groomer they are amazing.

Because we checked her in in the evening, bella was assigned a human to play with her until she could get evaluated in the morning to play with other dogs. it sounds like they do some kind of eval where they bring your dog around a pack of stable dogs to see how they interact and then once they "pass", they're allowed to go play with the other dogs. she said we could call the next morning to hear how the eval went and see how she's doing in general. Great place!

Our two dogs each went through the training boot-camp here when they were pups. Fantastic results and a lifetime of free follow-up help. There is nothing better in the universe than tech-support for your dog. Whenever we have an issue, or question we can just call or drop in for a quick work session. Priceless.

We have boarded her at this location.  They were great and friendly. The lady on the phone was really nice and informative.  They excercise and spend time with your dog even if it is not social with other dogs, which is great!  There are o't a lot of places equipped to board non-social dogs and provide more care than food and lodging.

I've taken my dog to swimming therapy after a broken leg and Yvonne was wonderful.  My dog is terrified of the water and never wanted to go in, but Yvonne was so patient with her and kept her swimming and working, but was always aware of how exhausted and nervous my dog would get and allow her little breaks.  She also offered useful tips about trying to get my dog to relax, but I think the swimming therapy overall did help her and build her confidence.  It's a little expensive, but it was worth it!  She still won't go in a pool, but she did dash right into a creek and a lake up to without hesitation and before she would steer clear of all water.

It is such a relief to know that your dog is in safe hands and is having a blast all day. By the time we get his leash off, he has already disappeared into the play area. When we pick him up, they always have a report for us on how he did throughout the day. My dog happens to be very shy and takes a while to warm up to strangers. You can imagine how happy I was to show up and see him thoroughly enjoy getting petted by one of the staff! We would not go anywhere else!

I've tried 4 other dog daycare places in West Los Angeles and this is the best.  It smells good, super clean and the staff is great.  I also use the dog grooming and boarding.  The price for daycare is 30 when you buy a package.  They have webcams so you can watch your dog play. I like their selection of treats - organic.  And the hours are better than most - 7 to 9pm.

Amazing place!  My frenchie has been going here for the dog daycare for the last 2 months and I also boarded him for a week.  My dog is happy here, place is spotless and smells good.  During my trip i was able to watch him on the webcam play with the other dogs.  You can tell the staff really loves dogs and cares about their experience. Great boarding option.   I also used their grooming and they did a great job!  I'm glad this new place opened to West LA!

I've been to a lot of dog daycares and Citydog is really different than anything else I've seen.  For one, it smells great!  It doesn't smell like dog!  It's spotless clean and has a cool, modern vibe with the music and the overall look and feel.  Everyone is really friendly and they always take great care of my two dogs.  My dogs pull me in at the entry so I know they are happy. I really feel that they love the dogs here.  I've also tried the grooming for a bath and trim and also a furminator treatment - happy with the results.  I was surprised how much less my dog sheds with the furmination.  The prices are good, surprisingly less than other options in area.  They also have a webcam, and it works!, so I can watch my dogs play which is cool.  So glad this new place opened - I love it!  Citydog is the best!

I LOVE the Kennel Club LAX!!!.  Sammie, our pet, is not a dog to me.  He is like an adopted son who is short, hairy, walks on all fours and does not speak clearly.  But, he is our baby boy, and when he is at the Kennel Club, I know they treat him just as I do...as my baby boy!! It is hard to find a business and other people who understand this concept, but the staff at the Kennel Club gets it!  They know him by name, they know his requirements, they know his personality...and they even know me! I have been with the Kennel Club for many, many years and with the 3 brittanys we have had.  The years have been full of happy, successful memories….... Many years ago I checked out all kennels in West LA, Santa Monica, South Bay area, Malibu and the valley because I wanted the BEST  for my babies, at any cost and at any distance for home.  I chose the Kennel Club and I am very, very happy with that choice for all these years!

I have several times asked my dog, Lizzy, to tell me about her stay at the Kennel Club @ LAX, but she only wags her tail, too overcome w/ joy at seeing me to talk rationally.  I know she enjoys her stays, since she is familiar with all the caregivers and never balks or hesitates to enter at the beginning of a visit. Upon pick up I always get a frank and honest "report card" on her stay and neither of us has ever had a moment's pause about the experience.  I have recommended the facility to friends and family unhesitatingly.

The Kennel Club has been a God send and a life saver. i could not have my little girl without them. She feels safe and right at home with the Kennel Club as though they are family and that's because that's how they treat her. She doesn't mind coming to visit, in fact as we round the corner she gets very excited. She is always happy to see all of the staff at the Kennel Club and must say goodbye to EVERYONE everyday before she leaves.I know the Kennel Club loves her and I love the Kennel Club and they take such wonderful care of her whether its daycare or boarding. The Kennel Club is highly recommended by me.

MAGIC MIRROR PET GROOMING is the perfect place to take your pet for grooming.  Everyone is super sweet and very accommodating.  I couldn't understand the previous rating for this business.  Perhaps that person was difficult from the get go.  I would highly recommend MAGIC MIRROR for any and all your pet grooming needs.  Plus I just love seeing the horses, chickens and their baby chicks.

Alex's place is a little hard to find, but worth  it if you're tired of paying high prices to get a smelly, dirty dog back. My dog, Mickey, is frankly, a little pig. but Alex bathes him until he looks, feels, and SMELLS clean. Mickey doesn't like most men but LOVES Alex. Other places told me he was hard to handle and one even refused to do Mickey but Alex has the patience of a saint. If you love your pet like I love my Mickey it's not easy to trust them to a stranger but I trust Alex. You can see by the way he handles all his four-footed customers that he really loves animals. Oh, and his personality cuts are great too. Ask to see "litle Ricky" and you'll see what I mean. Just the best!

A friend took my yorkie to Alex about 2 years ago and I was really happy with the results.  For the sake of time I would take PoPo to another groomer closer to my house, but it seemed she would come home WITH FLEAS !!!  Needless to say I was not happy.  I then decided No Place But Alex The Dog.  We have been happy ever since.  Thank You Alex and staff greeters =)Marquitta M.

I can't imagine that anyone would have a bad experience here. I've had terrible experiences previosly with daycare facilities that smelled poorly and were overly crowded. Whenever I'd pick up my Cockapoo, she smelled bad and it was like she couldn't wait to get away from the place. But she LOVES Urban Dog. She is always very excited to go, and seems very happy (and tired!) when I pick her up. I've had her there for day play and overnight boarding. The staff are always very friendly, and patient with all of my questions. I like that they immediately recognize her (even though I don't go every day) when we walk through the door. There is a big window in the front so that you can see the dogs playing. Would recommend to anyone.

Today my "mom" took me to Urban Dog for an interview. I am a very shy, mid-sized mixed-breed and was very nervous in the beginning. A very nice, gentle professional came out to greet me, he was introduced to me as "Bob". His calm demeanor and soothing voice made me feel comfortable right away, plus his outfit matched my coat, so I knew he had good taste! He walked me into the back so I could sniff out the facilities and ask the other dogs how they were. Everybody there was wagging tails, happy and clean. I passed my interview and am looking forward to spending time making new friends at URBAN DOG! I give it a two paws up!!Pros: Very knowlegable and friendly staff. Easy dop off and pick up.

If I could give more than 5 stars, I would, because Natalie is a fantastic real estate agent. She has nothing but the client's interest in mind. She was "spot on" with her 3rd choice of a property to show us. We loved the condo and the area and signed papers the same day! She is knowledgeable, experienced, honest, communicative and works within the parameters you give her. She helped us to buy EXACTLY what we were looking for. Our closing fees were paid by Flat Rate LA Real Estate as promised. Highly recommend!!

Excellent, excellent, excellent! This flat-fee full service is EXACTLY as described, no hidden fees or extra costs. Natalya was GREAT when I had problems a few times and wasn't sure what to do. She answered the phone promptly, helped me fix my problems right away. She is friendly, professional and courteous. We sold our home quickly and over asking price, thanks to Natalya and her easy, speedy service. Very highly recommend Natalya and Flat Rate LA Real Estate - don't waste your time researching other services, like we did. This is by far the least expensive and best service out there. A million thanks ,Natalya & Flat Rate LA Real Estate!

My experience with Natalya and Flat Rate LA Real Estate was outstanding. We walked away with nearly $160,000 more than what our local real estate agent had told us we would get for it. Plus we saved $40,000 in commissions. If I am ever in the market to buy or sell a home, there is no one else that I would trust more than Natalya. Her model of providing full services and assistance with contracts and other documents at a fair fixed fee is excellent. Flat Rate LA Real Estate truly cared about getting me to closing with the best price, and my personal best interest always first. I can't imagine a situation where I would use a full cost brokerage arrangement. I would highly recommend Flat Rate LA Real Estate to anyone that is looking at buying or selling a home.

I have to say that Flat Rate LA Real Estate exceeded our expectations in every way.Natalya is the smartest realtor that I have ever met. She takes care of business rather quickly and efficiently. She is very thoughtful and thinks of everything.  From day 1 she did everything she said she would do. She is a person you can rely on and trust fully, 100% honest person who cares about the interests of the clients, and not about their own benefits. She is ethical, hardworking, personable and so very nice person you want and need to work with.She help negotiate when the house didn't appraise for what I asked and saved me thousands, plus I saved $20,000 in fees as promised.  So I found Flat Rate LA Real Estate to be completely professional and, more importantly, successful. It was truly a pleasure doing business with Natalya and Flat Rate LA Real Estate!!

Flat Rate LA Real Estate represented me as Seller. 100% professional in every regard. I'd had another broker before Flat Rate LA Real Estate. He didn't get the house sold, but that probably was my fault because I had the asking price too high and the broker agreed to list with my price. I think he wanted to get my listing and so he promised me to do the impossible. I listed with Flat Rate LA Real Estate with a bit higher price than Natalya suggested. Then I met with the appraiser one time and her appraised listing/selling price was spot-on. House didn't sell until the price got down to exactly what she suggested initially. Natalya was always available to answer questions, get the necessary paperwork signed and arranged for all showings. She always called and asked for permission to access the property when required I retained her over the phone and did electronic signatures on all documents. All very efficient, convenient and tidy. Besides the expert and professional representation, I saved $17,000 in commissions. Would use Flat Rate LA Real Estate again. Highly recommend!!

I recently sold my house through Flat Rate LA Real Estate in 2017. I really appreciate Natalya’s professional service in every aspect of her service.Flat Rate LA Real Estate were honest in evaluating the sales price for the property, had an excellent sales plan and executed the details in a most professional and energetic manner. The photographer captured our house in the best possible light and immediately we were watched by a multitude of eager buyers. After just one open house, our house was in escrow within two weeks. We had multiple offers which Natalya was able to skillfully bid up well beyond our asking price. The result and ease of the entire process was much more than we could have ever expected. We were thoroughly impressed with Natalya and her Flat Rate LA Real Estate team expertise, knowledge, and skill. We saved over $5,000 just in our commission! It was truly a pleasure doing business with Natalya and Flat Rate Real Estate!!

We had the pleasure of working with Flat Rate LA Real Estate and Natalya .It was phenomenal!!! Natalya was very attentive to our needs, helpful, diligent, and most of all she is a trustworthy broker who can be relied upon in every instance. We had two open houses and Natalya worked around our schedule and showed our house in the evenings and weekends. Her expert guidance was a gift during the entire home selling process. She excels at communication, and took the time to listen and respond to our needs. And in the end we saved more than $10,000 because we paid just $4700 for the listing service. This company seems to be interested in helping consumers save money and in keeping the real estate industry honest. I would recommend Flat Rate LA Real Estate to everyone.

When we found Flat Rate LA Real Estate -- we knew we hit the jackpot. So I made an appointment with Flat Rate LA Real Estate and met Natalya. Not only did we instantly love her personality -- we were immediately impressed by her drive to fight to get us the best deal and protect our best interests. Her level of expertise in the home selling process cannot be matched. She is someone you can trust and have confidence that she will do always the best for you. Natalya is very enthusiastic, caring, loves her job, is very trustworthy, and was always available when we had questions. It was such a refreshing feeling to know she was our line of defense against some of the headaches that can come with the exciting but -- let's face it -- at times, stressful -- part of the real estate process .With Flat Rate LA Real Estate we saved so much money!!  Incredible, would highly recommend!

Used Flat Rate LA Real Estate with good success. We were pleased with the responsiveness, the communications and very quick reaction and follow up time. Process from initial market analysis through closing was very good. The Flat Rate LA Real Estate worked well as a team and Natalya was excellent. We didn't feel that she was tied up or was busy with a client else there. She jumped on the questions or problems and get them resolved. She ordered professional pictures, did open house and showed our condo to potential buyers. The closing and all contracts were very easy to do electronically. We saved about $6000 from using Flat Rate LA Real Estate. I would highly recommend using Flat Rate LA Real Estate as a seller.

Flat Rate LA Real Estate has proven to me that flat rate commission system can perform well. Natalya made selling our condo easy and it only took about 18 days from the day it was listed! We sold it for exactly what she predicted on day one, so she knew the market well. She was very available whenever I need to contact her, by phone, text, or email. The photographer took very professional photos and Natalya got it on the market immediately! She with our permission showed the home and we had a quick sale and the act of sale went very smooth. She is ultimate professional, but also a nice lady who did a great job for us. We saved more than $14,000 and I would highly recommend Flat Rate LA Real Estate to anyone who is willing to sell their home with the best service and save thousands!

We were very happy with our experience with Flat Rate LA Real Estate. Like most first time sellers of a property, we were a little unsure about the team approach that Flat Rate LA Real Estate offers. We were amazed at how quickly Natalya acted and responded throughout our process. She was with us every step of the process. She makes herself available at times when you wouldn't expect (calls back or responds to text messages when you wouldn't expect her to). You couldn't ask for a more professional and knowledgeable agent. Within a 2 weeks we had an accepted contract, and for about $18,000 over the asking price. We couldn't be happier with our decision to work with Flat Rate LA Real Estate and on top of it all, we saved over $12,000 in realtor fees.

Flat Rate LA Real Estate is an amazing company who is looking out for the people! Realtors have been robbing people blind for years, it's disgusting and extremely frustrating when you understand how much of your hard earned money they are stealing just to buy or sell your home. We used Flat Rate LA Real Estate to sell. Our home sold in weeks, for much more than I ever expected. They took very professional photos and got it on the market immediately! They were very responsive to all our questions and managed to sell our home extremely professionally. They took the time to understand our goals and helped us achieve them. We will recommend them to anyone we know looking to buy or sell a home.

Going with Flat Rate LA Real Estate was the absolute best decision! The experience surpassed our expectations. They saved us $15,000!! Right into our pockets. Our own equity went to us instead of to realtors. I will never use a traditional realtor again. I was skeptical at first because you do hear things like “realtors won’t bring buyers to your house if they see it was listed by Flat Rate Realty.” That was never the case for us. I know that our house was priced right, so the claim that Flat Rate tries to price your house lower to get a sale is not true. We priced our house and Flat Rate LA Real Estate had no problem listing with our price. Times are changing with selling your home and Flat Rate LA Real Estate is the way to do it. High tech, excellent communication and support. They is professional and work with you the entire way. Don't hesitate and give them a call!!

I found Flat Rate LA Real Estate and Natalya by searching on Zillow for a Realtor and I saw that this team got many high reviews so I thought I would give them a call. I found out that all high reviews were very well deserved. Everything was AMAZING from the start through the very end. The service was exactly what I was looking for and ended up saving me over $32K in broker fees. Natalya is a highly honest and experienced agent. I was impressed with her punctuality and energy. She is knowledgeable and extremely reliable. She has a charming attitude and is obviously a great asset to her company. In addition, Natalya is trustworthy, positive, and will always make you feel at ease. She conducts her business Flat Rate LA Real Estate with the utmost professionalism. I recommend her and Flat Rate LA Real Estate   without reservation!

I would VERY highly recommend Flat Rate LA Real Estate to everyone! I had a great experience, they really deliver. I will never use another agent again! Natalya was prompt to respond to my requests for information and provided a GREAT value. She was there every step of the way and on top of every issue with no delays. She took so much stress off me from knowing how to handle every detail. Flat Rate LA Real Estate truly cared about getting me to closing with the best price, and my personal best interest was always first. Natalya was ethical, knowledgeable and professional at every turn. And I walked away with nearly $30,000 more than what all real estate agents had told me I would get for it plus I saved more than $22,000 in real estate commissions.

I guess there friends left the other reviews. This company is definitely special stay far away!  They operate under other names too such as world unity. They have the same CEO and president on all of them. They are notorious for taking deposits and other things. Please check Yelp, Google, and the BBB for a proper understanding of these people.

We found the house we liked, thanks to Bruno, but it was not exactly what we wanted because we wanted to make a couple of changes. This is not a case of settling for what was available, but a real case of no matter what house we bought, it would need some modifications. Bruno didn't blink an eye. He contacted some housing remodelers, at no charge, and put them in touch with us.We got the house we wanted and got a great deal on the making the changes we had to have. Bruno went above and beyond service on this one.

If you are a first time home buyer, the process can be scary. Really scary. I mean you're looking at buying a house for one. That means you're going in and out of complete strangers' homes and trying to decide if you like the house enough to buy it. Then you have to arrange financing (and rates are going up so do it now!). If you've never signed mortgage paperwork, you need to bring two pens. Fortunately Bruno was there every step of the way. He helped explain the mortgage paperwork.Call Bruno. He'll put you first. He will do you right, as my Momma used to say.
 -

Bruno is as close to perfect as I could ask for in a real estate agent. When it came time to sell my house, he came over and looked the house over. He made a few suggestions of things that needed to be done around the house before he sold it for me. I took his advice and did the work. I can't swear it made a difference, but I did turn a small profit on the work I did when the house was sold. Highly recommended! And you can't beat his 39-day guarantee.
 -

 - 
Frankly, I just got tired of living in a Los Angeles mansion. I got tired of the property taxes, the power bill and the maintenance. When I found out Bruno would either sell my house or buy it, I said, “HAH!” he'll be buying my house. And he sold it for me. Then he  helped me find a much smaller place with far less monthly expenses attached to it. Go Bruno Go!

Hands down this is the best law firm that I've used. Ms. Mathis and Mr. Carpenter was very helpful throughout the entire case. I mainly was assisted by Ms. Mathis and she was great. Any time I had a question or concern she gave me a clear explanation. Response times were phenomenal. I've never had to sit and wonder if they received my email message or phone call. I'm  still amazed at the service and outcome of my case. I know 5 stars are the max that you can rate  a company but they truly deserve 10+ stars. Thank you again for providing excellent service. I will definitely refer any of my friends/family that's in need of legal assistance to your firm. Continue the great work and I hope you all continue to thrive.

First I would like to say that I am completely at fault for falling so far in my back-taxes. I was w-2 then 11 years ago switched to 1099. Needless to say, I couldnt afford my taxes due. I waited and waited but was never able to catch up. One day I was hit with a bank levy and wage garnishment. I called Anderson Bradshaw Conusltants because enough was enough. They stopped the garnishment within two days. It took longer(of course) to completely fix my tax mess, but they did. Completely honest and worth it. definite recommend!!

I am a truck driver and have been for 25 years. For the past 10 years I went without filing my taxes. I have back taxes, a levy, A bank Levy, And my wages were about to be garnished. I called Anderson Bradshaw consultants and within seven hours they stopped my bank levy. And released my wage garnishment. I am on the road to being settled with the IRS and state taxes. Also, I can go back to work without any worry.

I didn't get what I thought I would get when I paid for my daughter's tax case to be handled by this group. She ended up paying as much as she would if we had just done it ourselves. I should have just kept the $3000 I spent with them. Didn't meet expectations they set up front. Not a good experience.

I was a bit nervous at first trusting a company I found online to help me with taxes, but John immediately put me at ease. I owed over $75,000 to the IRS and had a number of missing tax returns and the IRS had already put a wage garnishment on my pay and had just hit my bank account for a sizable chunk of change. Within 24 hours of signing up John put me in touch with an ABC Attorney who got me my money back from the IRS and stopped the wage garnishment. I was kept informed throughout the process and every step was explained to me to make sure I knew what was happening. At the end, I only ended up having to pay the IRS $2,500. I cannot recommend Anderson Bradshaw enough.

I had not filed for 13 years!!!!! I decided to get married so I had to file but didn't have any w-2's or payroll tax information or deductions. Anderson Bradshaw took care of all of that for me. Now I am all caught up on my taxes and it feels great. I didn't even have to do a thing.

I came to Anderson Bradshaw with a $36,000 tax liability. After speaking with Mr. King, he put me in good hands with Josh Kronick. He immediately protected me from IRS Collection action, informed me every step of the way for what to expect from the process, and ultimately delivered me an Offer-in-Compromise that settled my tax burden for $500. I cannot recommend this firm enough. They gave me a fresh lease on life. Thank you!

When we received a letter from the IRS saying my daughter owed them over $18,000 for income in 2013, we nearly had heart attacks! Her U.S. income in that year was only around $5,000, because that was the year she started teaching in Asia. Calls to the IRS gleaned only a little information, but it appeared that an ex of hers had accessed her PayPal account, sold his products online, but not forwarded the information to her nor did he tell her about it. I found Anderson Bradshaw online, contacted them, and after working with Josh and Ted for a short period, they managed to get it all cleared up and proper paperwork filed to clear her of all liabilities. We could not have done it without their help, and I will be eternally appreciative.

I am a United States Navy Veteran, who recently found himself in hot water with IRS . They wanted all these old returns and W-2' s that I haven't seen in years . I called around for help but the tax preparers could only go back 2 years. The other tax firms wouldn't return my call. It was only when I contacted Anderson Bradshaw and spoke to Ted England that I was finally able to get the help that I needed. I am not some rich guy or some huge company ; however, Ted was willing to take the time to get my issue resolved. Thanks to Anderson Bradshaw Tax Consultants I am finally able to get my life back from the IRS.

I was paying the IRS $400 a month for 2 years and I was getting NO WHERE!  When I initially set it up I didn't realize how much they charged for penalties and interest.  It's down right criminal (but that's whole different story) Last summer, things got pretty tough for my wife and I, we were robbing Peter to pay Paul and we just couldn't keep up with the payment any longer.  I had spoke with a few companies a couple years back when all of this started, but they didn't seem like they could offer too much help.  Thankfully I found Anderson Bradshaw through YP and I'm really happy that I did!  I spoke with Ted, he was very patient and answered all of my questions through out the consultation. He explained our options and mapped out a step by step outline of how they were going to resolve our case. There's finally a light at the end of the tunnel for us and they saved us quite a bit of money in the end.  Thank so much for ending this nightmare & getting us that Fresh Start you promised

I CALLED ANDERSON BRADSHAW TAX CONSULTANTS. EXPECTING MR.BRADSHAW, GOT TED ENGLAND .HE SEEMED PROFESSIONAL AND KNOWLEDGEABLE,SMART. CAN ANYONE HONESTLY TELL ME WHAT TO EXPECT FROM HIM.IS HE FOR REAL OR WANNABE?

When I began my search for a tax attorney, it was my understanding  "serve this area" would have been completed in the state I resided.  My paperwork made it across the country from Los Angeles, California to Baltimore, Maryland.  The same paperwork had to be submitted twice, one for each office.   I would have felt more comfortable if the paperwork could have been handled once.   I know that I would have felt more confident  if I could have worked with the same person the whole way through the process.

I cannot recommend ANDERSON BRADSHAW highly enough. There is always a courteous person to answer my questions and I personally work with Bill Davis most all the time. He has dealt with all my inept questions and queries. My account is not completely settled but is moving right along and the results are definitely are meeting my approval! My husband and I had ourselves in a real mess and they are getting things worked out really well. If you have any doubts about this company...don't hesitate to HIRE THEM ASAP!

I'm happy to write this review. I called ABC Tax two months ago when the IRS put a lien on my home and levied my wages. I was in $85,000 in debt to the IRS from when I started my own business many years ago. I never made any money in that business and now the IRS is threatening to take everything I have. As soon as I was transferred to Jeff, he put my mind at ease.  He is very knowledgable about tax help and tax resolution. He told me that he can stop the levy that day. and that I could settle my tax bill for only 5k. You guys did what you promised and now that I am paying back my reduced amount, The irs is removing the lien on my home and now I have a fresh start.

These guys got the lien removed on my bank account in one day, and set up payments to the IRS that I could afford. Thanks, A-B!

My wife works as independent contractor and we got careless about quarterly deposits so after about 2 years we owed way too much. We looked around and this guy calmed us down and was able to get us some kind of compromise with the IRS  and payments that we can now afford. yes, we recommend them.

A tax preparer whom I have worked with for years turned out to be stealing from me. Michelle Moya Pearl stole my stimulus money, opened fraudulent accounts using my identity, and screwed me on my latest tax return when I began connecting the dots. Absolutely scandalous, this company is well aware of her wrong doings. Don't trust these people with your information or money.

Being legally bound to financial jargons all my life, I faced some tax evasion issues last year where I was going to be rendered superfluous by the court if they had acquitted me. Even though I was right in my own terms, with the help of OMG Tax, they efficiently discovered the fissures in the data I kept. It was truly an astounding experience.

Been using this company for a few years, we own a few properties and they have been servicing all our heating and AC issues. Always available, reliable, professional, and price is great. Just wanted to share my experience and write them a solid review.

This Guys Great!!  Needed new heating system, he came out and gave us an estimate right on the spot, told us about the MassSave program and got us $1700 back (we had no clue we were eligible for ) no hidden fees, very professional, everything looks fantastic. Great owner, his workers were very polite and cleaned up everything. Just hired them again for a relatives house in the Fall

During the blizzard of 2015 -- of course our heater died, called about 6 companies and no one would come within 48 hours. Called Green on a neighbors suggestion because they used them before, they came out within the hour, dragging tools through 4 feet of snow.. Solved the issue and had us up and running within minutes. Price (1/2 of what everyone else was asking in 48 hour period) Personality (great guy i think his name was Jim) Craft ( system hasnt run this good in years!!). Definately recommend them to everyone

GREAT EXPERIENCE - Had a leaking hot water tank on a Sunday, they came out rightaway, swapped out with a new tank, cleaned everything up and the price was excellent, also found a gas leak at the meter and fix that for free while they were here. Will recommend to everyone

Had no heat in my house and called Green Heating (referred by neighbor) - they came right out and fixed the problem quickly, turned out to be a 15$ Part and the labor was priced reasonably - tough to find honest people today!!! But they were great, polite and professional
 -

Recommendation from neighbor. They have been working on our heating system for about 3 years now, tuneups and 1 service call last winter.. Always on time, and our heating bill has been cut by about 30%. The owner Jim is VERY knowledgable and great to talk with... I recommend them to everyone i know.

Great company, easy to talk to, prices are reasonable. Used them 2 times for a service call both times they showed up within an hour and fixed the problem quickly. Had them  add a zone for our new addition, they worked in sync with our contractor and walked us through every phase. Will ALWAYS use them  and highly recommend them to everyone we know

We just purchased a 2 family and knew the heating systems were out of date. We called Green Heating after a little research and recommendations. Called them for a free estimate / evaluation, the next day they were at my house exactly on time (rare nowadays). After measuring each room, andchecking out our current systems, they gave me All my options Solar, Gas or Oil and a rough estimate for all the work. After deciding which way to go, we had everything in writing via email that evening. After signing the contract, they started the job 2 days later, they estimated 5 full days for 2 new gas systems and all new baseboard for both apts - these guys were professional throughout, finished right on time and cleaned up everything, like they were never there. VERY satisfied with our new systems and will definately use them on our next project.

We used this company per recommendation of a neighbor. We wanted to change over from oil to gas, and were interested in the rebate programs available. After making the call, they were at my house the next day. They measured every room and calculated our BTU's per room ( this was our 3rd estimate and the other companies never even looked upstairs) they then walked us through all of our options available for our home. That evening we had an estimate via email along with all of the rebate links. 2 days later we had a brand new system with an efficincy of 97.9% compared to our old system which was only getting 79%. They were very professional and thorough and actually took pride in their work (lost art nowadays). Will recommend them to EVERYONE we know.... Thanks again Green

Michael analizec and repaired in one visit what my old plumber has been trying to fix for about 2 years. He was prompt way cool and gave me great tips to keep my boiler running smoothly.  I threw away my old plumber's number and put this guy at the top of my list.

I would definitely recommend using Michael.  We were in a bind when we were having a dishwasher delivered by Home Depot, however, they never told us that we needed to have the old one uninstalled by a licensed plumber.  We found Michael on here and gave him a call.  He was near by so he came right over.  Home Depot delivery ended up just leaving us the dishwasher in the living room.  He uninstalled it and installed our new one with such care.  He even went to get us the correct parts since our old appliance had old ones.  He is very reasonably priced.  In the end I was glad that he installed it and not the other guys since he paid much more attention to detail and is so friendly.  And now we have a trusted plumber that we can call on for the future!

I have hired Sam, the project manger, to run a couple of different construction/remodeling projects and he has done a great job in keeping the projects moving forward.  The latest project that my wife and I hired Sam for involved a bathroom expansion to include laundry and a opening up two rooms into one room that involved a load bearing wall.  The project also included interior painting, hardwood floor installation on a stairway and laminate flooring.  Sam worked with the various tradesmen as well as building dept inspectors to keep all timely and orderly.  Sam also came through on a paint choice that would have been disastrous  that my wife and i had made prior to decide on the floor coloring.  Sam acted to advise us on a better color to match our final flooring choice.  We highly recommend Sam and Boston City Painting and Contracting.

BCPC has done two superb jobs for me.  The first project was a complete bathroom remodel on Beacon Hill.  The work required extensive permitting, working with insurance, working with condo Trustees, and working with condo neighbors.  Sam, the project supervisor, handled everyone diplomatically and effectively.  The team suggested some important add-ons to prevent future leakage problems (the original issue with the neighbors), did the work quickly, and created a simple, efficient, and attractive bath.  The unit's owner was extremely pleased both with the results and the cost.  I can't thank BCPC enough for the extra efforts to satisfy all the involved parties.Based on the first job, BCPC was hired to complete an unfinished exterior house painting project that was abandoned by another contractor.  BCPC thoroughly examined the work to date, highlighted areas of wood rot to be corrected before additional painting, and completed both the carpentry and painting in a timely and cost effective way.  The work held up under their guarantee and beyond.BCPC's attention to detail is what sets them apart from other contractors.  I will be using BCPC again for my projects as well as referring them to friends without any reservations.

Have lived in Beacon Hill for years and have experienced major issues (old pipe in basement burst) and minor (replacing fixtures) and the guys at Beacon Hill Plumbing have always responded immediately and provided excellent work.  When I put in a new kitchen they were able to do the plumbing and gas work, even though this is not their general business. They priced better than other plumbers who really were not interested in a small job.

My water heater was about to let go and my regular plumber had discounted it this morning because he obviously did not want to do the work.  As the heater began to leak, I called Beacon Hill Plumbing and Heating who had been recommended by my rental broker.  Steve was here within two hours, efficiently disconnected the old heater and installed a new one saving me untold distress and money had the heater given way and flooded my apartment.  Steve was friendly, professional and a no-nonsense worker.  Beacon Hill will have my business from now on.  I couldn’t be more appreciative.

Had some toilet issues but the guys over at Beacon did a great job fixing it! The plumber that came out was surprisingly well dressed, very professional, and really nice. Plus he wasn't that annoyed when my cat crawled all over him while he was working...poor guy! Bottom line, if you live in Beacon Hill and need a plumber this should be your place.

I had a great experience with BHP. I needed some difficult work done and they gave me the best impression out of all the companies who gave me quotes so I went with them. They did excellent work and I noticed they charged me for the actual hours worked which was slightly less than the estimate so that's a great sign of a good, honest company. I have recommended them already and will continue to do so. Thanks.

I was recommended to Drew Donarumo Plumbing by another condo owner in my building after multiple attempts to get people to even show up and quote a project. Drew showed up on time and took care of a leaky shower quickly before we had to go to work. A few weeks later, we got home late from work and noticed the toilet tank was leaking. I emailed Drew at 9:45pm and he wrote me back before 10pm and told me to call him at 7am. He was at my house at 8am and everything was fixed before 9. Really phenomenal to have some one who responds so fast and provides such a personal service. Theres nothing worse than knowing that you have something leaking or broken and worrying about how you are going to juggle your schedule to meet repair guys. He was a life saver!

My water heater broke and it was awful, my beautiful basement that we just redecorated was flooded and I was so worried about the brand new hard wood floors I put in!! I called up Drew who answered on the first ring,  and talked my husband through how to turn the water heater off (my husband is not a handy man). He asked us the information about the tank and we told him everything we knew. Next thing you know, Drew was at my front door step with a brand new water heater! It was like he flew there! He installed it with a reasonable price, and I'm glad to say my hard wood floors were saved!

Drew installed a hot water heater in my home in Woburn and I was thrilled with the service. His price was competitive, he showed up when he said he would and his guys cleaned up at the end. I even had a stupid question on how to turn the water temp up and he returned my call within 12 hours (and it was on a sunday). I would strongly recommend him

I have used Drew for the past 5 years.  He has been 100% reliable, ethical and honest as far as I am concerned.  All work performed was of a very high quality and the one time he needed to come back due to something out of both of our control it was immediate.

We had a clogged toilet that neither my husband nor I could fix. Roto-Rooter had the availability to send someone out the next morning. Charles (#4931) arrived promptly and was very friendly.

Roto-Rooter and Charles definitely have me as a loyal customer going forward.

We can’t say enough about the service we received from Roto-Rooter. From the initial call with Annette to the on-site work repairs with Ron we were in great hands! They were extremely  professional, knowledgeable and kind.  Ron (technician #5592) was awesome and solved our problem in no time.

1/28/2019 I was relieved, after suffering cold weather soft-clog related water damage from the third floor bathroom’s immense overflow down throught the three levels below it, through vents, ceiling fixtures as well as through the walls and ceilings in a few portions of the house, to have Scott and Joshua, Clean-Up Team Three out of Stoughton, MA, doing the removal of two portions of wall in the stairway of our 1895 Victorian house (which we have since updated—throughout 2014– without changing much). They made me feel just as easy while they removed a largish rectangle of ceiling on our second floor and disposed of the basement suite’s bathroom ceiling, wet all through, fallen in one piece on the floor.  They also provided the state-of-the-art anti-microbial cleaning needed in that basement suite’s bathroom as well as moving items in the way of taking down sheetrock and cleaning up afterwards. They were thorough, efficient and willing, hard workers who were fun to confer with.  Although, may it please fate that we never suffer water damage again—if we do, I will ask for Scott and Josh, Water Clean-Up Team Three out of Stoughton, MA.  Furthermore, Roto-Rooter provided me with an excellent and supportive estimator inKen, who helped me figure out the prime cause of the damage, well as an energetic project manager,Michael Delaney,who not only came to consult with Team Three but will handle our homeowner’s insurance claim for us.  The  first-line phone call receivers and schedulers were also personable and understanding of the anxiety the event and its aftermath has on the affected homeowner.They truly got me three-quarters on my way back to normal in two days.

Extra points earned for not waking the sleeping infant upstairs! ;). Thank you!

Mike (#2388) was extremely professional.  He arrived within the window promised and thoroughly explained what was involved in repairing the two issues I had.  I felt confident that he had the expertise to do the job.  He got to work quickly and snaked the pipe that was causing my washing machine to back up and not drain properly and fixed my dripping bathroom faucet.  I would definitely call Roto-Rooter again, and would be thrilled to have Mike assigned to the job!

This evening our garbage disposal was not working and all the water in the sink was backed up so that we were unable to clean our dishes by hand or using the dishwasher. We called RotoRooter and Ralph (#2925) came all the way from Brockton at 11:00 pm! He snaked the line and fixed the problem. He was very knowledgeable, patient, tidy, and thorough. We had a very positive experience. Thank you very much Ralph.

Ron got here very quickly, and the customer service on the phone end was also very prompt.  They gave me a window of 2-3 hours on a Sunday, but I got a call 10 minutes later that he was on his way.  Had a major clog in my main drainage under kitchen sink, and he took care of it very quickly.  Polite, quick, and the job was done.  I'd call them again based on this experience.

I had an a amazing experience with Roto-Rooter- from the initial phone call setting up an appointment that worked for my schedule to my plumber, Ralph, getting a difficult drain unclogged. When I initially called a local plumber he said it would take days for him to come out, and he might need to rip a hole in the ceiling to get to the pipe.  I decided to call Roto-Rooter knowing that they had same day service, and back up their work. I received a courtesy call a half-hour before the appointment, and Ralph assured me that he would be able to get the job done without needing to damage any other part of my house.  (On a side note I had attempted to do this myself with a Draino kit that came with a plastic snake to remove the clog. Huge Mistake! The plastic snake broke off inside my drain and I couldn't retrieve it. Luckily, Ralph got it out! I should have called Roto-Rooter at the first sign of a clog. Now I know who to call with any future plumbing concerns!)

We experienced a sewer drain clog, and called Roto-Rooter for an estimate. They offered a fair price for the service, compared to local plumbing companies. The tech for this job was very knowledgeable, and helpful, and knew exactly what the problem was and how to fix it. We were very satisfied with their service.

Bad service! No guarantee as promised.  Technician was rude.  Check around, there are more services out there than you thought.  I won’t recommend Roto-Rooter.My sewer drain backed up and I was desperate for help.  Like anyone else, I turned to Roto-Rooter.  Waited for 4 hrs to get a technician out, for the job.  Assessed the situation, the first thing the technician told me was to clean the waste to the clean out, so he can work on it, if I want him to do the job.  Off course I want to get it fixed, so I did. He got the drain to run, after couple of trials. He also sold me a gallon of Preventive Pipe Shield, only available from Roto-Rooter.Two months later, my sewer backed up, again.  I called the Roto-Rooter and was told I am still under 6-month guarantee.  They sent the same technician out.  The first thing he said was it was my fault that I did not cap the clean out, allowed sand to get in and clog the drain.  I told him I temporary cover the open with plastic bag, I had not been able to get the contractor to put the cap in.  I told him I did not believe it was sand clogging the drain.  He insisted it was sand and got upset why I didn’t have Roto-Rooter put the cap on.  He refused to do the job unless I pay for a new job.  I refused to pay and he left.  I called the office to dispute and was promised to have a manager call back.  I never heard back from the office.  I got ignored completely!  I got the drain cleared out and I was right, it was not sand.  It was old house with a lot of grease in the line.

We were very happy with Roto-Rooter. They were able to come out and look at an issue within a day and comeback for service within a week. They were delayed but called to let us know. I would call them again and recommend them in the future.

A technician came to our house, told us he could not repair the garbage disposal, and charged us $325. He quoted us that figure for repairing the garbage disposal which he was UNABLE TO DO. When I called the office to complain and get a refund, they were rude, defensive, and refused to refund my money. I am happy to pay for the tech's time, but $325 for 1 hour of work to inform me he could not fix it? Totally unacceptable. This company is disgraceful.

I had scheduled an appointment for the day after I called.  Later in the day that I called, I got a call from the company asking if I would prefer service to be that afternoon, which I agreed to.  My technician was "Josh" and once he saw the problem, which was a toilet dripping on both sides, he immediately explained how he would fix it & gave the cost.  He had exactly the tools & equipment in his truck for this particular brand of toilet so he was able to make the repair in a very timely manner.  Throughout the time he was here he was very polite & professional.  I would definitely recommend this company, & particularly "Josh", to everyone.

The waste from the kitchen sink started coming up the shower drain!  Called our normal plumber who tried plunging (which did not work),  recommended Roto-Rooter, charged me $45 and left.  Roto-Rooter arrived fairly promptly and dealt with the blockage, which was quite tricky.  The cost was a little high, I thought ($415), but what are you going to do?The problem has been fixed. Yah!

Our downstairs toilet backedup We called Roto-Rooter and the plumber came at the appointed hour. I emphasise the promptness of the response. The care of which the plumber brought his equipment in and out. His sharing with the progress of the process and the double check that he eventually made to be sure that the problem had been completley corrected. He also stated that through his company there will be a camera inspection made of the pipe to give direction of any further work if necessary.This had been the third time about every three years that the Roto-Rooter Company had been called due to tree roots clogging the pipe..Roto-Rooter Company will remain my best choice in the Greater Boston Services.December 29, 2010

Walsh's Plumbing and Heating has been dealing with all our plumbing and heating needs for over five years.  We are a school in a 150-year-old building, and all our installations are a challenge for any tradesperson.  The work done by this company has been outstanding in every way.  They are experts at getting virtually anything to work properly, and prefer to fix something rather than just replace it with something new.  Best of all, they work efficiently, and their prices are always reasonable.  We highly recommend them.

I have been using Hohmann for years. Personally, I have never had a problem with them. They have always been prompt, courteous, and fixed the issues quickly. Today is a good example. I knew my furnace needed some TLC, so I called yesterday and made an appointment for next week at my convenience - they would have come sooner, but I was tied up. The furnace decided not to wait and stopped working today. I called and asked if they could get someone out just to “jumpstart it” so it would be ok until scheduled appointment. Someone was here in less than a 1/2 hour and did what was needed for the moment. They took notes that they will pass on to the fellows coming next week. They explained the problem, what they did, and what to do if it shut down again. I would recommend them in a heartbeat.

Awful service! Plumber came to "fix" a problem with my water heater but made it worse! Poor troubleshooting skills. Changed my shower head, made my problem worse, at least before I had a hot water for ~10 mins, now it would run cold in 1-2mins. After a few calls, he came back later that day, replaced an element in my water heater, still problem was worse than when they first came! Kept calling them for 4 days to have them go back and finish, supposedly Scott the owner would call me. Never called!  Ashley in the office is very nice, finally passed my call over to Ed Hohmann, which was very rude, could care less about the fact that I had been without hot water for 4 days because of their incompetence, hung up the phone twice on me as I was trying to get this solved.I ended up calling another plumber. DO NOT USE THESE GUYS!

I needed a job done ASAP. I called them on Sep 18th and, they guaranteed me a service the next day 19th. I took a day off from work to wait for them. At first I was told that they would service me in the morning then the lies began. On the 19th I called them they promise to b at the house between 4pm and 5pm. At 5:23 I called to checked the status the guy didn't know me no more telling me they had an emergency and he will call me back for and update. No call back so then I try to call them they were gonna for the day or they saw my number and didn't pick. They been in the business for 50 years???? Surprise they still in business.

So I hired Attorney Barabino, which was the best decision I could of made.  This man works magic, and if I was to ever get into trouble again, I would want William Barabino to represent me.

Outstanding!   Attorney Barabino is an amazing attorney.  From th eminute I arrived at his office, to presenting my my case, my case was flawless.  Attorney Barabino made me feel at ease, and explained my DUI case to me in detail so I would understand everything.  If I had any questions, he was always available, or if he was in court, he would always get back to me. He is an excellent attorney who I would consider one of the Best.

My name is William Anderson and Joe Is my Attorney, but more importantly he became my friend. Joe I don't know how too thank you. Attorney Hennessy took me through a serious situation that i created myself. I found myself locked up with warrants in 4 different counties and little hope of getting home soon. Joe took my case's and got me released at the first court appearance in Plymouth county. He then followed me all over the state too resolve the rest of my legal issues. Joe's courtroom skills and knowledge of the law are in a class of there own. He completely out classed the prosecution in 4 different courts. Attorney Hennessy is now my friend as I have resolved all my legal issue's. I will continue to keep him on speed dial and I will   be forever grateful too him.

To Whom It May Concern,  I recently contacted your office for help with a 11 year old case from when I lived in Sherborn, MA. I sent an email and was called back within a few hours by Joe Henneessey, I explained the problem I had and he said he would look into it and call me back. Well, he did just that, two days later he called me, exlpained what I needed to do, and I made plans to fly to Boston. I arrived at the bus stop in Frammingham and Mr. Henneessey was there to pick me up, he took me all around the places need to resolve this legal matter and by 2:30 that afternoon, I was on my way back to the airport, matter resolved. Mr. henneessey stood beside me the whole time, stayed in contact with me about everyday, He is very professional and I would recommend him to anyone. Thanks Joe for all your help, you were great..

Its true, I wasn't a number to him.  He took the time to visit me in jail while I awaited my case.  He even stopped by just to say hi and to check on me to see how I was holding up.  He never gave up when the case looked bad, and he never gloated when it looked great.  He stood by me and treated me and my family with respect at all times.  I had many attorneys in the past that did treat me like a number and never cared about the other side of the case- my family.  They never showed the compassion that he showed and because of that I am grateful.  I highly recommend him.

Joe Hennessey took the time to review my charges and saw that my case was beatable.  My court appointed attorney wanted me to plead guilty but Joe saw there were problems with the search and suggested we file a motion to suppress the evidence.  His advice was correct and all of the evidence was suppressed as a result of an illegal search.  Joe saved me from going to jail when my previous attorney wanted me to take a 1 year sentence.  My wife, children and I thank you.

Mr. Joseph Hennessey is representing my daughter's ongoing case After four months of talking to lawyers about her case I found Mr. Hennessey. Reading about all his experience in law enforcement I spoke to him, he immediately met with my daughter. Legal defenders take on a great responsibility with your life in thier hands, Mr. Hennessey goes above and beyond the call of duty when he takes on a case. He is extremely competent and treats all involved with the utmost respect and digitiy at a time that is one of the most difficult in your life. A trait sorely missed, but one Mr. Hennessey has shown over and over a trait that sets him apart from all others in his profession that I have experienced in the last ten months. My family has complete confidence in his law abilities and knowledge. Mr. Hennessey gives us hope in knowing how hard he has and continues to work on her case. If you are ever in need for a compassionate, experienced, and trustworthy lawyer that is on your side I highly recommend your first call to be to Mr. Joseph Hennessey My family owes you a enormous graditude for all you have done and continue to do for our family.

I want to let everyone and anyone know what an exceptional attorney Joseph Hennessey is in the Family Law arena.  Attorney Hennessey has been my attorney in a very serious family law matter regarding my son.  It has been a very long bitter battle.  Attorney Hennessey has stuck by me the entire time.  He knows the laws, he researches everything, if he doesn't know it he will find it and he will apply all his knowledge to your case.  He is very smart and well versed in the legal field.  He will serve you in the best, fastest and nicest manner possible.  He keeps you informed and does not let you fall to the waste side as most attorney's do on a daily basis.  He will fight for your rights in the fairest way possible and he never comes up short.  He is not just a lawyer, but someone who will go above the attorney role.  He will support you and look out for your well being too.  There were many ways I felt defeated. Joe never let me quit.  He taught me to be positive at all times and look at the big picture. It worked.  We always seem to prevail.   Joe has not just become my attorney, but a trusted and dear friend.  Attorney Hennessey was referred to me by my friends and they are also very happy with his services.Trust in Attorney Hennessey you will be happy you did. Thanks for all you do Joe! If you need a reference I will not hesitate to give you one. Danielle

If you are caught up in a criminal matter or are potentially facing one, then hire Attorney Hennessey. In addition to his trial experience and vast knowledge of the criminal law, the years spent on the force as a police officer clearly gives him valueable insight in advocating for his clients. An individual's liberty can easily be taken away even when he is innocent. So finding the right Attorney with experience and knowledge of the criminal area is key. Attorney Hennessey demonstrates this zealously on behalf of all his clients in the criminal justice system.

As you read these reviews, you will see many of the same words: honest, ethical, straight forward, trustworthy, knowledgeable, professional, pro-active, dependable.  Marco is all that and more.  I was a very nervous landlord for many reasons and Marco always took the time to explain everything to my satisfaction.  There was never a question or concern that he overlooked and no matter I threw at him, he knew the answer. He was honest about any challenges I might face and I knew what to expect throughout the entire process.  He handles himself with dignity and treats everyone the same. Marco is a great attorney and a wonderful human being.  Hire him!

We were referred to Mr. Sandonato, through another lawyer to help us resolve a tenant/landlord issue; being that the landlord was refusing to refund our security deposit. After our first meeting with him, we knew immediately that we had made a great choice in legal representation. Mr. Sandonato  is down to earth; but also straight to the point, honest, and realistic about what to expect. Don't be fooled by his looks or low-key demeanor--- Mr. Sandonato, in the end, got us back 3x the  security deposit amount AND paid attn. fees. Not to shabby! It's been a month since we settled, and there hasn't been any complications or issues. We certainly wouldn't hesitate hiring him again.

Marco has represented us on several occasions, most recently through the sale of an apartment house which quickly became messy due to the buyer's attorney botching key components on their end.  Not only did Marco do his job for us, but he managed to catch and correct many of the errors of the other attorney.  Even though the sale to that buyer ultimately fell through, Marco protected our interests beautifully and we were never in danger of being damaged by the opposite council.  Marco worked with us until the house ultimately sold, and we closed on it knowing that every aspect of the sale was managed with the utmost concern and professionalism while granting us everything we requested.

We worked with attorney Marco Sandonato on a recent tenant claim and were impressed with his knowledge and professionalism.  Marco took the time to explain his strategy and worked for our best interest in getting a swift and fair resolution.  We highly recommend him and would work with him again in the future.

Mr. Sandonato is pretty much everything you need in a responsible attorney. He is responsive, trustworthy, frank and honest, and knows what he's talking about.I asked for his help for some work disentangling myself from some very difficult sublease tenants from an apartment in Massachusetts I was renting. It was a challenge because I was stuck in the middle - between a landlord that was very fair and subtenants who were otherwise.Marco gave me very strategic, sound, and successful advice on how to win, and I feel like I got the best out of it. Marco doesn't come off initially as one of those polished, pinky-out high priced attorneys, but that's because he's not.He's just a really solid "in-the-trenches Partner" that will get things done at a VERY fair price.Though I worked with him LAST YEAR, I felt compelled to come back and finally give him the recommendation he deserves. I HIGHLY recommend him.
 - 
 -

 - 
There's no words to explain the service I received from Marco during my eviction case. He made a tough situation easier with his professionalism. Again thank you very much and anyone looking for a great lawyer pick up the phone and call the man.

I had never been in an accident before, and I didn’t realize the paperwork could be so extensive and the insurance companies so unsympathetic. Luckily when I hired Joel Schwartz’s firm, they took the reins of my case and made everything a breeze, treating me like family the whole time. I got the settlement I needed and will soon be able to return to work. I couldn’t have survived the stress of it all if I didn’t have their team handling my case. Thank you!

I have only positive things to say about my experience with this law firm. My child was struck by a vehicle while riding his scooter in the road. I was devastated and so concerned for his safety and the future effects on his health. Joel H. Schwartz was professional, accommodating, and would answer even my silliest and most hysterical motherly questions without being condescending. The settlement was more than my husband and I anticipated, allowing us to get the best possible care for our son who is doing much better. Thank you SO much to this exceptional firm!

Hi Donald,    We are all singing your praises. You are now our official family lawyer!    I can't thank you enough for the incredible job you did for my mother. You were so thoroughly prepared and professional. Your winning personality absolutely shined in the courtroom. You were so likable and displayed such common sense, you led the jurors to the right decision. My brother Matt, who has been at hundreds of trials, said you were one of the best lawyers he has ever seen and he knew right after closing arguments that we won. He noticed some of the jurors smiling at my mother and not looking at the other side at all.    Your trial presentation was perfect, your closing argument was flawless! You highlighted everything that was important (the blow ups supported your argument perfectly) and you let the jury know what was absolutely NOT relevant. You were right about not allowing the small stuff to be distractions. I was particularly impressed by the way you spelled out the damages to the jury. They knew my mother wasn't trying to soak the other side, that she was only asking what was due her. Brilliant!    This has been a strain on everyone in my family and I always felt reassured when I talked to you. I knew we had the right lawyer when I read the depositions. You knew exactly what we were dealing with from the start.    Ever grateful,     Lois Evans

Austin is a bulldog when it comes to defending his client. He ferrets out every little piece that is beneficial to his client and is well known and respected in both civil and criminal courts. He has represented me in both courts and has always conducted himself in a professional manner. He is extremely knowledgeable and takes care that the client is well informed as to what he is doing. He has gone above and beyond in litigating my cases and is not afraid to research, looking for every angle to attack when neccesary. He is a six star rating in a five star review.

I have found that Atty Sweeney truly cares about his client's well being, their children and their financial circumstances.  He is very flexible on payments and really works with his clients to get them the most for their money.  He is very compassionate and caring, so anyone in a difficult situation should definitely give him a call.  He's not your typical attorney who just wants to take your money and litigate.  You won't regret calling on Atty Sweeney for his services.

Yes this is the alternative to the Loews Boston Common Movie Theatres. Theatre is nice and big. I went there only three times I think. One time with 2 friends of mine, I invited them. The second time was with my ex and the third time my ex and her friends. She invited me both times. They have a lot of food, drinks and snacks. The food area looks more like a food court at a mall. Thd customer service is ok. The screens are big and the seats are comfortable. The lines can be very long if the movie is huge so it will be best to leave the house early. The restrooms are clean. Parkings are free. The parking lot is huge. Many people go there because it's easy to get there and the parkings are free. The only problem for me is the stupid and loud teenagers. They are white black but the majority is hispanic because well you are in an area full of hispanics. White teenagers but mostly black and hispanic mothers come with their huge strollers and their babies are loud and cry. Good luck watching the movie. Truereview here to tell you truth.

Finding a groomer for your dog is like finding a new hair dresser. You get attached to someone that is really good and when you cannot go to them anymore you get nervous about finding a new one. This was how we felt when we moved up to Saugus last summer. We were not very familiar with the area and wanted someone close by and affordable that would be great with our little yorkie. Luckily we found Linda & Paws for Applause. With years of experience and a passion for dogs, they are really the best in the business. Their puppy cut on our callie is so cute and I love how they style her. She always looks fantastic and comes home with something decorative around the holidays. We have utilized their doggie daycare services for days that we work late and have also gone for a teeth cleaning (without putting her under) and they came out awesome.  I highly recommend Linda and her team to anyone that is looking for the best for their pet. The staff is loving and attentive to your pet as if they were their own.

I' purchased my dog from Linda 6 years ago, and have been bringing her back every month for grooming.  Paws has the best groomers in the area - years of professional experience.  Everyone always asks where I get the dog groomed.

We have been bringing our dog, Bear, to daycare here for over a year and can not say enough great things about this place.  It's family operated and the people genuinely love all of the dogs that go there.  Our dog gets so excited when we approach daycare and doesn't seem to want to leave (who can blame him - he plays with his friends all day)!If you are looking for a place with great rates and great people, definitely check them out.

I love Precious Pets.  It's obvious convenience living in Winthrop is a plus, but that's not the reason.   My dogs don't freak out when they go there, the gals are so good to both Seamus & Abigail.  You can also go in at any time, with no appointment to get their nails cut back.  they are very accommodating AND, most importantly, do a great job.  I highly recommend.

I have had the best experience with Precious Pets... have been to several places in the past.. and have not found such attentive people until now.. they love dogs there... that is first most important thing to keep in mind... that ur pet will be treated well...  I have a huge back yard... and my dog rolls around in the dirt...  making a mess of the white in his coat.. when i get him back from precious pets.. his fur is soft shiny and clean...     I think i found my dogs permanent grooming place..

My wife and I recently moved to Winthrop, and rather than drive 45 minutes to our old groomer we figured we would try the local place -- Precious Pets.  The first time we took our 2 Shih Tzu's there we left very unhappy.  We asked for slight trims -- both our dogs were totally shaved...  We should have known better than to bring our little guys back there, but we didn't. We gave them the benefit of the doubt -- not knowing our dogs, etc...  The next time we went back, we were extremely detailed in what we asked for.  I made sure the woman understood exactly what we wanted.  We're not picky -- we want our dogs short but not shaved.  Once again the dogs were totally shaved.  When I tried to talk to them about the service we received, they were extremely rude.  I paid, left a tip -- even though I shouldn't have,  and then told them we would never be back.  Precious Pets does not know what they are doing.  If you want your dog shaved to the skin, then this place may be for you... If you want to overpay for a shaved dog.  Otherwise, take the time to drive north to Dog Spa in Beverly or Bark Plaza in Rowley.  Bottom line --- STEAR CLEAR OF PRECIOUS PETS!!!!!

Today was my first and last trip to this place. I asked for a puppy trim and my puppy got a full cut. 2 minutes after I drop him off I called back to confirm and make sure that he would get a puppy trim 'cause I was with this bad feeling... when we got there to pick him up we were so very disappointed. Nick is a 16 weeks old Yorkshire and my son used to call him a Teddy bear, but not anymore, at least until his hair grows back again :-(

I have been taking my dogs to Central Animal Hospital for 17 years, and I highly recommend them.  I never have to wait long for an appointment.  We have been seeing Dr. Marks lately - she is very compassionate and has provided excellent care to my now elderly dog.

They are not a bad vet,  just not a good one.   I first started going here when I just moved to the  area and my dog was sick.   They did a fine job, with him, but ever since I have been slowly becoming more skeptical of my animal's care.     Dr Marks had me buy medicine that my cat did not need and seemed very hesitant to give me answer even a qualified one.    To make matters worse I  have had a series of poor communications and  very poor customer service.   Again they are not a bad vet just not a good one and it is quite obvious that they are way more interested in billing me than caring  for my petsI left this vet because they wanted me to sign a paper that they are not responsible if my pet is lost, when dropping my cats off for surgery.  I refused, I have been responsible for neutering several cats in NH and had never seen such a form.  The office manager called to talk it over with me and said that it is a MA law to sign a form stating such.  It was a bold faced lie as I just dropped my cats off at another vet in MA and was not asked to sign a form relieving them of responsibility for losing my pet.  This seriously brings their competence into question for me

Avoid!  I am familiar with a MSPCA investigation into this company where a dog died while in their care because it was left in an car, no ac, on a very hot day for an extended period of time.  While I live and work very close to this business, I wouldn't take the chance of this happening to my little guys and so I board my dogs elsewhere.

Doggie DayTrippers ARE THE BEST!!!! Please ignore any of the bad reviews that were written about this business. They have been nothing but PERFECT with our dogs.  The dog walkers are not only dedicated to our dogs (I have a year old yellow lab and a 9th month old black lab), but they have practically become family.  They took care of our black lab puppy from day one and looked after our yellow lab from the time he was three months old.  Our dogs always come back from their trips happy and very tired!  Furthermore, our walkers write PERSONAL notes about our dogs experiences and what they did on their hikes  EVERY DAY!!!  They even wrote to us when my yellow lab Beacon first learned how to swim!  Our labs adore their dog walker and are in great shape because of their trips outside the city.  This is a great organization which really cares about your dogs.  I can't say enough great things about it.  Don't let one person's experience influence your decisions.  Doggie DayTrippers are the way to go!!!!!  They really care a lot about dogs and go out of their way to take care of your babies.

This groomong salon is the absolute best. The grooming is exceptional. I particularly like the support that owner, Lisa, gave me with my newest pup. A real professional.  This salon is immaculate and the environment provides a safe haven for my dog during the grooming experience.  The many products and food choices make this salon a one stop shopping experience.

I'd be curious as to what vet looked at that puppy, as the vet I use there is nothing like the one described in the review.  . I've always been given  clear explanations and any options that are available.  Those options include second opinions and they've never balked at my expressing contrary opinions and discussing them with me.I'm curious as to how much the breeders' vet charged for all the tests on the puppy.  If it was a problem with the patella, shouldn't an x-ray have been enough?  I've bought puppies from breeders and have learned from experience to pick a vet other than the breeders' as they've turned out to be rather expensive.  In all fairness however, I don't know this breeders' vet.Granted, the VCA could be less expensive, but it should be kept in mind that they are a franchise and not a private practice.

I am a breeder who sent a puppy to someone in Boston and they took it to this vet. They told the person the puppy was unhealthy and would need surgery for a patella.  I tried talking to the vet and she did not even want to talk to me.  She treated me like I was an uncaring breeder. When I got the puppy back I immeditaly took her to my vet. She ran all kinds of test and found nothing wrong and could not even understand why she would need surgy for her patella it was only a one and as she gets older it might just go away on its own.  I can't believe some vet would just assume the worse and want to preform unnecessy surgeries. I believe the are only in itfor the money and do not care for the animals.  My vet also wanted to discuss this with them and they refused

Most of the people who work in grooming are so nice. I would recommend using any groomer except for the grooming manager Heather (no customer service skills, very rude). Sometimes it's difficult finding an employee to help you locate something in the store but overall the employees are very nice and helpful.

Well, I am very disappointed with this place and how a person who supposed to take care of pets has such a neglected attitude,  zero patience and mean ! Heather at grooming just missed to tell us i don't want to cut your cat nails ,  we decided to just leave because of her bad attitude,  she didn't want to deal with our pet after we told her he is not easy to cut his nail.  Gave us such a bad attitude in an  unprofessional way !

The definition of a sociopath is, essentially, one who sees no consequence to others, on ones self.Meet James "Call me Doc" Sawyer.This man will screw you out of every penny he can while oozing sleazy -so-charming-, we're a big family here, crap all over you.I sat for 35 minutes in his waiting room and watched a Spanish-speaking woman with 3 small kids totally taken advantage of; the dog was dehydrated from diarrhea,  they quoted her $780.When she said they could not afford that much she was quite plainly told that she should have taken care of the dog and this would not have happened, and then, in front of her children, she was told the dog was going to die if they didn't do as "Doc" recommended.Nice.My problem here is that MY dog, I was told, had been to Constitution Beach as well (true), and had apparently picked up the "same thing that disgusting  little shih tzu had".{"But she shouldn't have had a dog in the first place" and 'It would be lucky if it lived".}Then I was told to give my dog some canned pumpkin, and feed her ground beef and rice for 3 days.WTF?!?!THEN I was charged $178 for the experienced.I can honestly say that I paid $170 for the advice and purchased that mans integrity for $8.Shame on you James Sawyer.You're full of canine feces, sir.

There is a reason why Boardwalk is #1 when it comes to renting out places in the Boston area. They are the best! They gave my and I amazing customer service through every step of the process.

Highly recommended.

Mr. Kelley made the process about as simple as it could be taking our huge list of desires and finding places that fit our criteria and budget.  We ultimately ended up getting a great deal on a place that I thought would be too expensive after looking at their website.   He called each of the places and found out what their special rates were and had a whole binder full of information waiting for us on our tour day.   I couldn't have asked for a better situation.  Thank you so much.

We had a huge luck to work with Tatyana on buying our two condos in Brookline. Being a Brookline Realtor for many years, she is extremely knowledgeable about Brookline real estate, provides excellent and thoughtful counsel, and knows the ins and outs of the home buying in Brookline. She was tireless in helping us investigate every opportunity in the extremely challenging Brookline real estate market. When we did find a home her negotiating guidance saved us thousands of dollars and showed us how to win against a few different bids from other buyers. She navigates you throughout all phases of home buying from home hunting, providing recommendations on offer, price and even after the deal was over on real estate taxes and other aspects. She also was able to rent out our first condo within a month even though it was winter time. Tatyana is an extremely hard-working Brookline real estate agent: you just cannot do better. We recommend her enthusiastically.  Frankly, we are missing Tatyana’s positive attitude and definitely will call her on all and any of our future Brookline real estate sales and purchases.

I’ve worked with Tatyana, THE Realtor in Brookline, for several years and highly recommend her for any clients, whether buyers or sellers looking in Brookline. She is incredibly responsive and responsible. She is detail-oriented and thorough and always acts in the best interest of her clients. We have worked on numerous real estate purchases and sales in Brookline and Boston and all of them have gone smoothly because she makes the extra effort to help her clients with the necessary due diligence to prevent any problems or issues before they even arise. We also have yet to need to address any post-closing issues as she diligently assists her clients in ensure that all matters are properly handle by the time of closing. I can’t emphasize enough how great Tatyana is to work with either as a buyer’s agent or listing agent. You can’t go wrong with Tatyana, THE real estate agent in Brookline, representing you and working on your behalf.

A few years ago, we had to sell a 2BR condo and sell it quickly. It was a strong buyer’s market since the Boston real estate bubble just burst and prices plunged. As an experienced DIYer, I listed my condo in Brookline for sale by owner. Lots of interest, but months passed by and we weren’t getting any reasonable offers. We were constantly low-balled by buyers trying to take advantage. At one of our open houses, Tatyana walked in to take a look. She checked out the property and said: “I might have a buyer for you. I know someone who is looking for a condo in Brookline like yours.” I was very skeptical because there’s simply no magic. But Tatyana said: “just give me a chance.” It took me two weeks to process the thought, but since no offers were coming in, I decided to give Tatyana a call. We scheduled a showing with a potential buyer. Then they came back with Tatyana again. And in 7 days we had a very reasonable offer that we were very glad to accept! And thanks to Tatyana, real estate agent in Brookline, MA the transaction went very smoothly. She acted as both seller and buyer agent and did absolutely great in both roles! She helped to organize inspection, smoothly sign purchase and sale agreement, clarify all questions with the town hall and fire department, clear for closing and answer many, many questions that both parties had. I am very glad that we met Tatyana and grateful for her excellent real estate matchmaking skills! I look forward to Tatyana’s help for all our future real estate transactions!

I have had a great experience with Tatyana, real estate agent, as my listing agent in Boston - Brighton, MA in 2017.  Also, I bought a condo in Brookline in 2005 where Tatyana was a listing agent. When we were buying a condo in Brookline Tatyana provided us with a report of sold units in Brookline and good advice that helped us make the best decisions. We were very happy with the purchase of our new home in Brookline Village and the buying process overall.  Our communication with Tatyana didn’t stop after that. We were calling Tatyana with any questions we might have. After twelve years of our communications I called Tatyana and asked her to help me to sell my house in Brighton. The property I sold with Tatyana in July, 2017 was a 90- year old Victorian house in Boston.  I kept it as an investment property and could never imagine how many repairs it needed until I decided to sell.  Tatyana provided unique marketing on the house that I would have never thought about and was organized, diligent, extremely patient, and super responsive throughout the selling process. She has great negotiation skills so making a compromise between me the seller and a buyer was very natural for her. I am glad that I sold my house and the most I am glad that I had Tatyana who has been a guiding light throughout this sale. I can’t imagine having gone through this process without that level of support and expertise. I can't recommend her highly enough.

Excellent! We first met Tatyana at her open house in Coolidge Corner, Brookline in 2005. Coolidge Corner real estate is always in high demand and we felt we were very lucky that she was a listing agent for the Brookline home we bought. Tatyana performed as a highly professional real estate agent who was dedicated to the seller and at the same time very honest to us, the buyers. In other words, she is a realtor who can make a win-win for the parties after getting to know them and their goals/interests. Since then we stayed in touch with Tatyana and used her as our buyer's agent in Brookline and seller's agent in Boston. She knows the Brookline real estate market and surrounding area incredibly well. She also has a great network of professionals including plumbers, electricians, handymen etc. and we call her first when we need any repairs. And another nice touch of hers is that each year we are still getting birthday cards from her. Tatyana is a really devoted real estate agent. I would highly recommend her to anyone selling or buying Brookline real estate and Boston!

I am so lucky to have found Tatyana. She helped me rent a condo. She very quickly found terrific tenants and did every detail with amazing communication, in a thoroughly professional manner. She was available promptly for questions throughout, and offered excellent advice for listing the unit. She was friendly but also concise so that time wasn't wasted. I so appreciate her and the work she does. When I have to rent again I hope she will be available.

I am writing to recommend Tatyana as a real estate agent in Brookline, MA 02446.  We recently worked together on a significant purchase for a mutual client, and it was a pleasure to work with her.  Tatyana has great integrity and she is very knowledgeable about the Brookline and Newton real estate market.  Tatyana is zealous and strategic in her representation of her clients.  She brings charm and warmth to each transaction that can help to finesse delicate negotiations.  She is patient, a good listener and a very hard worker.

Tatyana is a real estate agent in Brookline, MA who is truly amazing--an exceptionally competent, caring person and professional. She manifested intelligence, dedication, and integrity at a level I have rarely seen. She saved me when I had a condo in Brookline that had sat for 6 weeks without being rented out by Sept 1 (a key date in the local real estate market). I had worked with a prior real estate agent who did nothing--truly nothing--for 6 weeks and I realized I had to act quickly and switch to a new agent. I was so very lucky that Tatyana was willing to work with me - within days she did more than the other person had done in 6 weeks. She helped me identify what I needed to do to improve the look of the unit; she gave me names of contractors, painters, etc; she was able to drop by to let the workmen in at times when I couldn't; she showed the unit to numerous people and ultimately found a terrific tenant within a few weeks; she  moved the paperwork forward quickly and negotiated all of the details w/ the prospective tenant. It was, quite simply, an incredibly positive process. Tatyana is, in short, a gem of a person who earned my trust quickly and increased it every step of the way. Thank you so very much, Tatyana!

I have never, ever had a real estate agent as kind, thorough, and trustworthy as Tatyana. Tatyana is a highly professional and fabulous negotiator. I listed with her my condo for sale in Brookline after the other realtor was not successful at all. She sold my Brookline home with much over asking price from the First Open House. Unfortunately, we also had a lot of specific requirements in the sale of our Brookline home beside the price.  It seemed to us she put the rest of her life on hold during this critical period to achieve our goals. From the first phone call/meeting through closing we called her countless times and she was very caring in answering whatever questions we had. My family has never been happier during and since selling and for me Tatyana is just the best real estate agent anywhere.  Thank you Tatyana! I would refer her with the strongest recommendation to anyone who is thinking to buy or sell real estate in Brookline or Boston.

The best real estate agent in Brookline, MA you could ever ask for. Thoughtful, highly professional, and very honest! Before meeting Tatyana I put my condo for sale in Brookline with another realtor in March. It was sitting on the market for 45 days with no offers or at least no offers presented to me in writing. I found Tatyana online. She has proven herself as an outstanding realtor who is an expert in Boston/ Brookline real estate market. Tatyana was very strategic with the listing price from the beginning.  As a result, she sold my house from the first open house with greatly over asking price.  I felt very lucky to have her represent me as my seller agent. I felt that she had my best interests at heart, truly helping me. And because she is so personable and caring, Tatyana is a pleasure to work with!!  Seriously, if I ever buy or sell a home again I will follow her anywhere.

Exceptional Real Estate Agent!  Saved My House from Foreclosure! I am still not sure if it was a dream that I sold my house. Today is the day when my property was to be sold at public auction as a foreclosed home in Boston. I am very happy to say with tremendous help of  an amazing real estate agent from Brookline, MA I avoided foreclosure and my home was closed today with enough money not only to pay my loan but with money left for me. Her name is Tatyana. Within three days my condo for sale was listed on MLS and advertised on multiple social media websites online. She sold my home from the first open house (through the bidding war) ! She was my main contact with the bank to get payoff and avoid the foreclosure action.She was the main key to stopping a foreclosure sale. I was amazed at her persistence!   I recommend her to anyone who is thinking to buy or sell real estate especially the sellers and buyers who want to be represented with the special attention she provides.

I consider Tatyana to be the go-to source for everything related to the Brookline real estate market. I have used Tatyana when both buying and selling condominiums in Brookline. Tatyana is client-focused and advises her clients drawing from her deep well of knowledge about the Brookline market. Her advice always benefits her clients, and she operates with her clients' long term happiness as the primary goal of the real estate transaction. I simply would not consider any real estate transactions without her trusted guidance.

Tatyana, is amazing to work with.  Last summer I had a difficult time to find an apartment or condo in Brookline. I had already called some Brookline real estate agents but did not get the help I needed. I found Tatyana, who has highly rated online as a Brookline real estate agent and she immediately offered a list of available apartments for rent and condos for sale in Brookline. Tatyana is a hardworking, sincere, and creative Brookline real estate expert.  She isn't afraid to take on additional work and to accommodate the client’s needs.  She listened to my questions and concerns, showing everyday more and more houses, meanwhile being super patient, friendly, professional, extremely accommodating, and well informed. Through her suggestions and advice she provided a great deal of comfort and guidance throughout home hunting. I will make a point to work with her again and again and I give her my highest recommendation!

We met Tatyana at an open house in Coolidge Corner, where my fiancee and I were looking to buy our new home and were exploring the area.  Tatyana was an amazing resource: she knew which units were available and gave us a nuanced history of recent sales in the area.  She promptly sent us information and made herself available at all times for questions -- and we had many! She is by far the most knowledgeable Brookline realtor we have encountered.  Should we ever decide to move, we will certainly sell the condo through her. If we need to buy another Brookline condo, she has the best pulse on the market. I highly recommend her!

I had the pleasure of working with Tatyana, real estate agent in Brookline. I was the closing attorney in a couple of real estate transactions in Coolidge Corner, Brookline. Tatyana was very diligent, extremely professional and very responsive to all of my requests. I would highly recommend Tatyana as both a listing and buyer's agent in the future.

If you need a real estate agent in Brookline, look no further than Tatyana. She was recommended to me by a colleague. I was moving to Boston from Texas and did not have time to travel to Boston to find a place in person. After one phone call with Tatyana, I realized that I was in the best hands to find a home in Brookline. She immediately understood the type of place I was looking for and continually demonstrated her expertise by guiding me through the rental process and giving me her honest opinion of different units. She was literally my eyes and ears in Boston, and was always available by phone or email. Because of her diligence and tireless efforts, I found the perfect apartment in Brookline. Thank you Tatyana!

Highly recommended! We can not say enough good things about Tatyana, realtor in Brookline , MA . We bought an investment condo in Coolidge Corner, Brookline , MA with the help of Tatyana. She is a great advocate, with persistent reminders and suggestions she provides a great deal of support and guidance during and along the way after the transaction. Tatyana is a very hard working, highly motivated real estate agent with a passion for success. She brings great energy and enthusiasm to her work, and she is highly respected by both buyers and sellers.

I am writing to express our great satisfaction with Tatyana, a real estate agent and realtor in Brookline, MA.  She helped me and my son purchase a condo in Coolidge Corner, Brookline in 2005. Throughout the entire process of searching for a new home, Tatyana was very knowledgeable and motivated to find the right property for us.                                                                                                                                                                                Tayana is honest, strategic, unbelievably patient, and utterly professional. She also understands the Brookline real estate market exceedingly well. We are grateful we found her and fortunate to know her.

FlatHound was a great help when we were looking for our apartment. Mike showed us maybe a half dozen places before we found one we liked. He was very responsive, and great to work with. We recently learned that a couple we know went through Mike at Flathound and signed a lease for a property down the street from us. They are excited, and we are excited for them! We highly recommend FlatHound Realty.

Michael has been fantastic. After feeling a bit frustrated and deflated from working with several other companies, Michael was by far the most responsive to my wants and needs. Within days he had compiled a list of great apartments and I am very pleased with my new place! On top of that he has a great personality and goes above and beyond to make the process a more personal experience. I will absolutely be sticking with Flathound for my next apartment search!

Roger helped my boyfriend and me find a great apartment. He was flexible, friendly, and willing to work with us on the criteria we wanted. He was patient and he went the extra mile to be sure he only showed us apartments that fit our needs. He genuinely wanted to help us find what we were looking for, and eager to answer our questions. I have recommended Roger to many people and I will certainly go with him when we move again.

Me and my family have used Home Team Moving for 3 separate moves now and are going to use them again for an upcoming move. Could not be happier with their service!!! They are always extremely helpful with the entire moving process. They are supper affordable and even came in at under the estimate. Fast, reliable, professional, obviously experienced and supper accommodating, wouldn't hire anyone else!!!

We used HT Moving to move from a 3 bedroom home on the North Shore to a small flat in Cambridge, so the move wasn't straightforward since many items had to go into storage.  They did a great job - efficient and well priced.  They were on time, their crew was courteous and worked quickly and carefully, they laid down our carpets and in short order we were up and running in our new space.  I knew to call them because of a previous experience with my company.  We were moving our headquarters from BUMC to the Seaport and engaged them to move the office side of our business.  We are a lab.  When they came in for the quote, I realized they could probably also do much of the lab moving - and they did!  We saved a lot of money by doing this because lab specialty companies are very expensive.  They were on time, did a great job, finished early! and my fellow employees came into our new space on Monday with everything in place and ready to rock - including the lab.

Home Team Moving is the only moving company you want to call.  They do large moves and very small ones too, like removing my unwanted stove from my new basement.  They were efficient, and that stove went up the cellar stairs, as if it has been preparing for it every day.  It was up and out.  Great friendly moving guys!  Just know that they also give estimates at your house and help you plan your next move!Highly recommended.

They offer great service and they really know what they are doing.  They have a CPA on staff who has been doing individual and business taxes for 30 years.  If you have a problem with your return, bring it to them.  Chances are they can help get things straightened out.  Better yet, have them do your tax return so that you won't have any problems later!

I had my taxes prepared on the spot they accept walk ins which is great. My regular w-2 with student credit no dependents came to $45.00 wich was great. Other places were charging to much. The only thing about this location is the parking but for the price you can park your car around the corner. I will defenitely go back next year.

Tatyana Moroz is the most professional accountant we have ever met. She provides an excellent customer service, treats us as the most valued customers, and helps us to file tax return very skillfully. Because Mrs. Tatyana is very detail oriented and never misses the important points, we may sleep well. Tatyana Moroz is not only a very professional accountant, but she also has a fantastic personality. Very attentive, intelligent, patient, smart, and very responsive. We would like to appreciate her excellent job she is doing for us and for many other clients for years! Her clients love her very much!!!

Hands down this is the best law firm that I've used. Ms. Mathis and Mr. Carpenter was very helpful throughout the entire case. I mainly was assisted by Ms. Mathis and she was great. Any time I had a question or concern she gave me a clear explanation. Response times were phenomenal. I've never had to sit and wonder if they received my email message or phone call. I'm  still amazed at the service and outcome of my case. I know 5 stars are the max that you can rate  a company but they truly deserve 10+ stars. Thank you again for providing excellent service. I will definitely refer any of my friends/family that's in need of legal assistance to your firm. Continue the great work and I hope you all continue to thrive.

Used these guys to help me with my offer in compromise. They filed tax returns and reduced my back tax debt. I am now in great shape and saved thousands.

First I would like to say that I am completely at fault for falling so far in my back-taxes. I was w-2 then 11 years ago switched to 1099. Needless to say, I couldnt afford my taxes due. I waited and waited but was never able to catch up. One day I was hit with a bank levy and wage garnishment. I called Anderson Bradshaw Conusltants because enough was enough. They stopped the garnishment within two days. It took longer(of course) to completely fix my tax mess, but they did. Completely honest and worth it. definite recommend!!

I am a truck driver and have been for 25 years. For the past 10 years I went without filing my taxes. I have back taxes, a levy, A bank Levy, And my wages were about to be garnished. I called Anderson Bradshaw consultants and within seven hours they stopped my bank levy. And released my wage garnishment. I am on the road to being settled with the IRS and state taxes. Also, I can go back to work without any worry.

I didn't get what I thought I would get when I paid for my daughter's tax case to be handled by this group. She ended up paying as much as she would if we had just done it ourselves. I should have just kept the $3000 I spent with them. Didn't meet expectations they set up front. Not a good experience.

I was a bit nervous at first trusting a company I found online to help me with taxes, but John immediately put me at ease. I owed over $75,000 to the IRS and had a number of missing tax returns and the IRS had already put a wage garnishment on my pay and had just hit my bank account for a sizable chunk of change. Within 24 hours of signing up John put me in touch with an ABC Attorney who got me my money back from the IRS and stopped the wage garnishment. I was kept informed throughout the process and every step was explained to me to make sure I knew what was happening. At the end, I only ended up having to pay the IRS $2,500. I cannot recommend Anderson Bradshaw enough.

I had not filed for 13 years!!!!! I decided to get married so I had to file but didn't have any w-2's or payroll tax information or deductions. Anderson Bradshaw took care of all of that for me. Now I am all caught up on my taxes and it feels great. I didn't even have to do a thing.

I came to Anderson Bradshaw with a $36,000 tax liability. After speaking with Mr. King, he put me in good hands with Josh Kronick. He immediately protected me from IRS Collection action, informed me every step of the way for what to expect from the process, and ultimately delivered me an Offer-in-Compromise that settled my tax burden for $500. I cannot recommend this firm enough. They gave me a fresh lease on life. Thank you!

When we received a letter from the IRS saying my daughter owed them over $18,000 for income in 2013, we nearly had heart attacks! Her U.S. income in that year was only around $5,000, because that was the year she started teaching in Asia. Calls to the IRS gleaned only a little information, but it appeared that an ex of hers had accessed her PayPal account, sold his products online, but not forwarded the information to her nor did he tell her about it. I found Anderson Bradshaw online, contacted them, and after working with Josh and Ted for a short period, they managed to get it all cleared up and proper paperwork filed to clear her of all liabilities. We could not have done it without their help, and I will be eternally appreciative.

I am a United States Navy Veteran, who recently found himself in hot water with IRS . They wanted all these old returns and W-2' s that I haven't seen in years . I called around for help but the tax preparers could only go back 2 years. The other tax firms wouldn't return my call. It was only when I contacted Anderson Bradshaw and spoke to Ted England that I was finally able to get the help that I needed. I am not some rich guy or some huge company ; however, Ted was willing to take the time to get my issue resolved. Thanks to Anderson Bradshaw Tax Consultants I am finally able to get my life back from the IRS.

I was paying the IRS $400 a month for 2 years and I was getting NO WHERE!  When I initially set it up I didn't realize how much they charged for penalties and interest.  It's down right criminal (but that's whole different story) Last summer, things got pretty tough for my wife and I, we were robbing Peter to pay Paul and we just couldn't keep up with the payment any longer.  I had spoke with a few companies a couple years back when all of this started, but they didn't seem like they could offer too much help.  Thankfully I found Anderson Bradshaw through YP and I'm really happy that I did!  I spoke with Ted, he was very patient and answered all of my questions through out the consultation. He explained our options and mapped out a step by step outline of how they were going to resolve our case. There's finally a light at the end of the tunnel for us and they saved us quite a bit of money in the end.  Thank so much for ending this nightmare & getting us that Fresh Start you promised

When I began my search for a tax attorney, it was my understanding  "serve this area" would have been completed in the state I resided.  My paperwork made it across the country from Los Angeles, California to Baltimore, Maryland.  The same paperwork had to be submitted twice, one for each office.   I would have felt more comfortable if the paperwork could have been handled once.   I know that I would have felt more confident  if I could have worked with the same person the whole way through the process.
 -

 - 
I cannot recommend ANDERSON BRADSHAW highly enough. There is always a courteous person to answer my questions and I personally work with Bill Davis most all the time. He has dealt with all my inept questions and queries. My account is not completely settled but is moving right along and the results are definitely are meeting my approval! My husband and I had ourselves in a real mess and they are getting things worked out really well. If you have any doubts about this company...don't hesitate to HIRE THEM ASAP!

I'm happy to write this review. I called ABC Tax two months ago when the IRS put a lien on my home and levied my wages. I was in $85,000 in debt to the IRS from when I started my own business many years ago. I never made any money in that business and now the IRS is threatening to take everything I have. As soon as I was transferred to Jeff, he put my mind at ease.  He is very knowledgable about tax help and tax resolution. He told me that he can stop the levy that day. and that I could settle my tax bill for only 5k. You guys did what you promised and now that I am paying back my reduced amount, The irs is removing the lien on my home and now I have a fresh start.
 -

These guys got the lien removed on my bank account in one day, and set up payments to the IRS that I could afford. Thanks, A-B!

My wife works as independent contractor and we got careless about quarterly deposits so after about 2 years we owed way too much. We looked around and this guy calmed us down and was able to get us some kind of compromise with the IRS  and payments that we can now afford. yes, we recommend them.

I trusted Turbo Tax. I was wrong. Checking the boxes wasn't easy, if you don't know what to check.  Once I received the IRS notice, I turned to Kimberly at File 4 Me, based on a referral from a friend. File 4 Me, got me straight with the IRS. Now, life is good.

I visited this spot after going to JW and H&R for years.  The prices at these places were high and I did not get the personal service I required.  The owner at F4M sat with me to help me understand my tax situation and how the numbers are figured.  I really appreciated the knowledge and helpfulness.  I will be back next year.

A tax preparer whom I have worked with for years turned out to be stealing from me. Michelle Moya Pearl stole my stimulus money, opened fraudulent accounts using my identity, and screwed me on my latest tax return when I began connecting the dots. Absolutely scandalous, this company is well aware of her wrong doings. Don't trust these people with your information or money.

Being legally bound to financial jargons all my life, I faced some tax evasion issues last year where I was going to be rendered superfluous by the court if they had acquitted me. Even though I was right in my own terms, with the help of OMG Tax, they efficiently discovered the fissures in the data I kept. It was truly an astounding experience.

Then why are you staring at your computer screen?  Run, don't walk, down to City News to let your mind be boggled by the truly incredible selection of periodical publications they stock.  If you haven't been there you don't know what you're missing!

Walking into this store is like walking into another world.  Before I went to City Newsstand I had no idea so MANY magazines even existed.  They have magazines on almost every topic you can think of.  They carry odd titles like "Dairy Goat Journal", "Haunted Times", and "Fire Apparatus Journal".  They have all of the standard stuff you'd find at Borders but everything else, too!  The staff is friendly, helpful and knowledgable and the shelves are arranged in a logical manner which makes the otherwise seemingly impossible task of finding the magazine you're looking for among the thousands they carry easier than you'd think.

They tried to sell me an ad on their website, www.veteransview.com.  Told them "maybe".  That same day, they sent an email claiming that they would "publish" (online) the ad if I did not respond within 3 days.  I responded immediately & told them VERY CLEARLY, in writing, that I WAS NOT AUTHORIZING the ad, as I hadn’t had sufficient time to review it. Now they're insisting on payment of $300!!!!  Told them I had never actually ordered the ad, & to please stop billing me, they informed me that it was "too late" to cancel the ad, (it's on their WEBSITE, where a simple mouseclick could remove it). I asked them to remove the ad from their website, and they refused!!  I have received 5 bills, 2 letters threatening collections, & another letter threatening me with small claims court! THIS BUSINESS USES SHADY, DISHONEST PRACTICES & BULLYING TO TRY TO "FORCE" PEOPLE TO BUY ADS THEY DON'T WANT.  Please see the numerous complaints on the BBB Chicago website.

Do not work with these people.  They are crooks.  They called me about advertising on their "Healthcare Times" paper.  I forwarded the information to my listing agent, she declined service.  Suddenly, months later, they sent me a past due bill saying that I ordered service.  I have the e-mail that declined service.  Plus they just grabbed a year old listing from the internet that had the price of the house wrong by $150,000!!!!Now they are trying to get me to pay for something that I didn't order.  Look at the BBB record too.  They are bad people.

They are cheaters, they offer advertising in a magazine ( i didn' confirm the order) and they charge me...  and then try to collect sending lawyers letters.Bad People!

DEFINITELY RECOMMEND. I called and Kathy answered. She was pleasant and helpful. She had Tom call me and I explained that my sump pump was going on every few minutes and it is January and we checked everything in and around the house. We couldn’t find anything wrong. So Tom came out to assess what was happening. After determining nothing was wrong in the house. He walked to the street and checked the street sewer. I’m impressed. He then told me it’s a city blockage and to call Public Works. I can’t THANK YOU enough Tom. Very wise and professional man. I would recommend this company and Tom to my family and friends.  THANK YOU Again

Our house is approx. 27 years old. We had 3 shut off valves in kitchen replaced; 3 shut off valves in downstairs bathroom replaced; 4 shut off valves in laundry room replaced; house side shut off valve replaced; new hot and cold pipe run in laundry room and a new laundry tub and faucet installed.The price was very reasonable and the work done by Eugene was excellent. He showed up on time and got right to work. When he left no additional clean up was necessary. Everything is working fine and looks great. Anyone asks me I would definitely recommend Southtown Plumbing for their quality work.

J&B Plumbing and their techs are amazing. We discovered late on a Friday night that our drain was backed up in our laundry room, also connected to the drains in the kitchen and water was everywhere! On Saturday morning we called J&B Plumbing based on the Yelp reviews and came over with in an hour. Once the tech arrived he was able to clear the drain in less than 45 minutes and charged us the lowest level of the estimate. What a great plumber!

J&B Plumbing really are hard workers; they arrived when promised and went directly to work. I had a problem with our pipes backing up, leaking and a shower that only produced hot water. I haven't been able to find an honest, reliable, fair plumber until now. These guys are great!!! Straight to the point, honest, fair prices that probably saved us a few hundred dollars in repairs. Look no further, call right now!

"I called J&B Plumbing to fixed our laundry sink water clogging problem. When our tech Jeff came he was very nice, he is very professional and friendly.  I also had him check out our toilet bowl leakage, he suggest to me that I can save cost by replacing the toilet bowl water pump by myself. Gave me the parts name and where to get them. At the end, he even denied tipping, plus gave me a 10% discount for running a little late!This is unreal! He is our plumber for life! Highly recommend Jeff for sure! Bravo Jeff! Thank you very much for your good work and professionalism!"

We had a kitchen sink drain backup and were pleased with the response time of Roto Rooter - within an hour of my call, he was here.  Reise, #1877, was calm, patient and listened carefully to the background info I provided.  He asked follow up questions and promptly started work (after I agreed to the quoted price).  He was thorough and explained what he did, once he was done.  No mess was left and he was 100% self sufficient - he had all the equip, tarps and towels needed to leave my kitchen in the same state as it was when he arrived.  He also verified the smooth running drain line and no leaks in the pipe he had to open.  This is our second time using Roto Rooter.  For messy backups they will quickly provide a solution.

I had a gentlemen by the name of Reise, Tech #: 1877, come out earlier this afternoon to look at the unfortunate plumbing disaster in my home. And it ended with him being absolutely patient and generous about it. He kept me very informed on the problem every step of the way and how we can get to the bottom of it to making sure it doesn't get this bad again. It was very much so appreciated to have had his help with the job that he 100% completed to the best of his ability. Which also gave me good comfort in knowing that I wasn't getting ripped off like others would unfortunately. I knew that the price was defiently worth it and I was left happy as well as satisfied with his service to fixing the situation thus far until the next step of getting it cleaned now. I would more than anything recommend Reise over any other person in this company let alone over any other company in general. He was also a lot quicker than I expected which was very nice for it being the weekend.

When sewage leaked from our main line into the basement we called roto rooter. Our tech Felipe (3033) was professional and informative. He explained everything that he did and was pleasant. I would recommend their services for avast service, even on a Saturday.

I had an excellent experience with Roto-Rooter today.  Reise (#1877) is extremely knowledgeable about sewers, drains and plumbing.  He patiently answered all my questions and put me at ease.  I have had a negative experience with other services as a female home owner but not with Reise and not with Roto-Rooter.  My  toilet was clogged and slow to drain, but Reise was able to fix the issue and now we don't have to run up 2 flights of stairs to use the upstairs bathroom any more!  #sohappy#

Hassle free from start to finish.  Called in late last night-scheduled a four hour window for the next morning.   Stubborn clog resolved before 10:30.   From my first call with Customer Service (sorry I did not write down your name) to Brian in dispatch, and ultimately the technicians were professional from the moment they said hello.  Even when the original technician had a problem with his equipment-he made sure not to make that my problem.  Instead he got a hold of his dispatcher-and rerouted the ticket another tech-who arrived in just a short amount of time.  He also communicated that I had an appointment to be somewhere later in the day-and had to be serviced as soon as possible.  That is when Tim #2508 showed up to the rescue.  He had all the information he needed, so I did not have to repeat anything I told anyone else.  He was in and out very quick, very clean, and made sure I knew about the 6 month guarantee!  Can't go wrong with that.

Don (#3145) is an excellent plumber!!  He was very personable & informative!  I tried to do the job myself but wound up calling Roto-Rooter & thankfully I did because Don came out & walked me through the entire job which there was no way I could have done.  My ticket number is 20901479 if needed for reference.  I definitely recommend Roto-Rooter (especially Don)!  Thanks!!

This is the second time we've used Roto-Rooter for a scary plumbing issue, and once again they've done an incredible job. Not only were they able to come right away, and give us an accurate estimate of cost, but they solved the problem in only a few hours and I will be able to get in half a days work now! I was really impressed with how knowledgable our tech was (Rick #1080) and how lovely he was to explain everything and help us decide what was best for us to do to solve our issues. Unlike other services I've used, Rick noticed when a problem didn't require out-and-out replacement of parts, and helped us fix a minor problem that I'm sure other plumbers would have sought to convince us was a major one. Roto-Rooter is my go-to plumbing service now, and the job is totally guaranteed for a year, which makes me sleep so much better at night. I'm very happy with everything.

We had sewer backup in our basement.  We called on a Saturday night and scheduled a Sunday appointment.  The work was extensive, but the employee at Roto-Rooter did a great job diagnosing and repairing the problem.  Hardly any waiting and they were personable in handling our problem. A frustrating plumbing situation overall, but Roto- Rooter helped minimize the cost and frustration, and helped us get back to doing laundry and taking showers as quick as possible.  I would recommend them.  Wheaton, IL

All-Line Sewer is a family oriented business that treats its customers as if they were exteneded family.  They are honest and direct. They do not sugar coat your problem with unnecessary estimates or try to sell you services you do not need.  They are prompt with their service and reasonable with their prices.  And, their work is thorough and strong.  I recommend All-Line Sewer to all my friends and family or anyone else that is in need of excellent quality sewer service!

Being a first time home owner this was very frightening and cold experience. Mr. Burris is totally all of the above and made me feel confident that the right man was in my home. I truly will never let anyone else to any work for me, but this first class gentlemen.  Please know whenever someone cannot tell you promptly what is not the problem and keep moving until he finds the real problem is the real man. Mr. Burris is nothing to play with. Either it is a yes or no situation when he ask you a question.  He is only trying to find out what you did wrong so it may be corrected.  I love this man already.  I will be contacting him for my central air system soon as I can.   I will never ever use anyone else.  Mr. Burris is the man..

Please note the above address for Burris & Sons is correctly 7850 S. Colfax.This was my first time calling Burris & Sons, I called a few other companies before trying to give my service to whoever could accommodate my emergency. Although Mr.Burris stated he had appointments that called in prior  to me, he went out to give me fast and productive service right away. I needed a tough job of a main line rod out and he thoroughly serviced this for me quickly and effectively. I highly recommend.

My husband and I have been customers of Burris and Sons for over 30 years and the service has always been prompt and the problems resolved. This has included air conditioning and heating systems maintenance, plumbing issues, sump pump replacement and drain clearing.  In addition to being a responsive local business, I recommend this company to family and friends as a business that leaves you with a good feeling when the service call is completed.

I have used this company (Gilchrist-Traynor)  since 2006.   It is  the best  in Oak Park, Illinois as far as I am concerned!

This is a company you can thoroughly trust!!

I was in need of a new water heater and found Full Circle Plumbing & Sewer on Youtube being featured on the Housesmarts TV show with Lou Manfredini installing a tankless water heater - Matt and his team were professional, courteous & friendly.

I used Full Circle Plumbing & Sewer for a kitchen remodel that was quite extensive in a house that was 75+ years old and required repiping and a lot of work.  Matt & his team were knowledgeable, affordable and kept the project on track.  I was always able to reach him as this was a project that lasted a while, so it was nice to know he was just a phone call away.  They did great work and cleaned up after themselves.  I will be using them again!

I had been struggling with my bathroom for a while, it was super stressful, there was always water on the floor until I contacted Bert and I can't say how AMAZING he is. He was available on short notice and on the weekend. He came promptly and his job was fast and expert. He was extremely detailed about what needed to be done before the job was done, let me just say that I'm a girl and had no clue about plumbing at all but he provided me with estimates prior to performing the actual job with reasonable prices. I highly recommend this company, make sure to ask for Bert.

This place is a life saver. We had water coming out of our basement drain for a house we had just recently bought, and they came only a couple hours after we had called. 8674-Herman did an amazing job. He was so friendly and made sure to get the backup completely cleared. His supervisor even came by to help and used a camera to look into the pipe to make sure the blockage was completely gone. If you need anything done this is the place to go.

The water in my kitchen sink didn't drain and nothing worked to clear it.  I called RotoRooter and within the hour they sent Michael Tech # 4305 to solve the problem.  He cleared the line, tested it to make sure, cleaned the kitchen area of water and offered a product to keep the drains clear.  I truly appreciate the discounts he applied to my bill. His initial quote took my breath away.Thanks

Steven replaced the water heater ina  very short period of time. After discovering the new water heater that he had in his truck was damaged, he went out of his way to address the issue.

I ordered a dumpster in July after my house flooded. I threw away all my things that were damaged form the rain. I ordered it on a Wednesday and recieved it early Thursday. Driver was friendly and curteous enough to ask how bad my damage was. When i was ready to have it picked up i called in and they came about an hour afterwards. All in all i have no complaints. They had the most reasonable prices and i would order from them again.

I was in a car accident in 2009, and my experience with McCready was great. His office was on top of everything and the case didn't take a long time. I've even called them after to ask questions and they have always been very helpful. I would absolutely recommend them to others.
 -

McCready, Garcia & Leet has worked really well in my daughter's case. I have no complaints. They call me often and keep me informed, which is something others normally wouldn't do. I would recommend them in a heart beat.

My family had an unfortunate experience at a factory and needed the experience of a workman's comp lawyer that not only knew the law but spoke Spanish as well to make us feel more at ease.  Well, Edwin Reyes came to the rescue.  The initial consultation was free and we didn't have to pay anything if the case wasn't won.  Oh and 5 stars to the assistants and all the office staff there, especially Alyssa.  Any question we had, little or major- they were there either on the phone or in person ready to answer.   Always friendly, always smiling, making my parents feel like real people not some case number.   THANK YOU!

The work that McCready, Garcia  & Leet has done for me has been excellent, from beginning to end! It's been tough but Ray has been very honest, knowledgeable, and very helpful. Joan has also been excellent. I have to give them a high rating because I know I wouldn't have made it this far without them. I thank them so much for all their hard work and  for doing  everything possible in my case. My only regret is not reaching out to them sooner!

Very professional people . The staff is very friendly. I was involved in a car accident a few years back and went into the office to speak with Mr. McCready and he took my case. It wasn't long after that my claim was settled. I would use this law firm again if needed.

Look no further because this is the Best Law Office in the USA.   They are not only genius but treat you like you are family as well.  They keep you informed of everything that is going on with your case as well as afford the opportunity to call at any time.  The office staff are awesome too and will go above and beyond to get your needs met.  The attorneys and staff work as a team to help their clientelle.   They fight for every penny then look elsewhere to get more for those injured.  This law practice is phenominal and Mr. McCready rocks!!

Just a note to thank you for the way you handled my car accident case. I didn’t want to have to deal with the hospital bills or the insurance companies, I just wanted to focus on getting better. The case turned out just the way I’d hoped, and I am very happy with the recovery.

McCready Law Offices really went the extra mile for my case. They kept me informed on the progress of the case and were always very friendly. I would advise anyone that has a work-comp case or gets into an accident to call them.

I was injured in a car accident and didn't know where to turn for advice.  I contacted McCready, Garcia &Leet.  Attorney McCready was sympathetic and explained my options.  He was courteous and professional at all times.  I was very pleased with the way my case was handled and with the outcome.  I would highly recommend this firm.

I had injured myself at work and was not sure what to do. Someone told me to contact a worker's compensation attorney and I contacted Attorney McCready. He was very helpful and explained what needed to be done in terms of contacting my employer, getting treatment and receiving pay while off work. He handled all the negotiations for me and I was very pleased with the results. I had no idea what to expect but Mr. McCready and his staff were always available to answer my questions and provide guidance throughout my case.
 -

I wasn't sure if I needed a lawyer or even wanted a lawyer for my car accident.  I am so glad I had Mr. McCready represent me in my case.  He handled every aspect of my case and answered all my questions.  I had no idea what to expect in terms of an outcome, but I was elated.  If you ever need a personal injury lawyer, you definitely should call this lawyer!

Not your Typical Lawyer He is a Lawyer 2.0 I have owned a few businesses and sold them , I also have bought and sold a lot of houses. My family has had their fair share of issues, I have dealt with more lawyers than I care to admit. I am used to talking to lawyers, talking to them they are burnt out, and don't really care. They care more about the money than they do the client. Mark does not, I am used to the lawyers that mastered the art of dragging stuff on and you end the call thinking wait what?. Call Mark! it doesn't take long to realize this guy is different. He has a real passion about what he does, He walked me through what I needed to do and when to do it, something that the lawyers I am used to would normally charge me thousands. Mark talked to me in a respectful way and In a way I could understand and he just wanted to help. He is the lawyer you want on your side, the guy works like a bulldog out of the court room and a Lion in the court Room. I promise you will thank me. You will find out quick he is no bs, he is passionate and doesn't want to waste your time or his. He is ranked 100 in the nation. I'm Very Happy with him, anyone who needs a lawyer I am giving them his info. He is a incredibly smart individual, I could talk a little polish, a little Lithuanian and even a little German with him. You wont regret it!

David was the best lawyer ever, I was referred to David and I must say this guy is awesome! David was a good listener and explained in details the possible outcomes and how the process would go. David cares about his clients, and doesn't judge you, and represents you to the fullest extent of the law. I was very pleased with the outcome of my son's case. He received two years probation and after he completed his two years probation David was able to get his record expunged. David doesn't sell dreams he makes dreams come true. Thanks for allowing my son to have a second chance at life!!!!!

I was charged with Domestic Battery and a Order of Protection was issued on me in my own house. After hiring Mr. Smith I felt a relief that I would not have to go this course alone, I felt I had someone who had my best interest at heart. We took this case to trial and WON, he was like a young Perry Mason. At any rate not only was I found not guilty of Domestic Battery the OP was thrown out. By the way I also hired Mr. Smith to serve this individual a 30 day notice to vacate my property. Needless to say I'm one Happy Camper with the services I received from David Smith and his team. I would Highly Recommend anyone with issues such as mine to contact Mr. Smith so that at least you will be able to breath.

If I could rate 10 stars I would!!

One of the best Chapters 7–13 in the state of Illinois. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for relief. There are no hidden fees or Bs.They are fantastic people to work with, and they don't leave you hanging. They help you every step of the way. They always respond super fast to any email or phone calls. In particular, Michael Butland and Linda They will definitely help you sleep better at night. They do all the paper work and filing for you, and they have affordable prices. Their payment plans are very reasonable. I never saw an agency with such a high rate of positive experience. I saw one negative review, which didn't make any sense at all and is most likely from someone in competition with this high-rated law firm. I love them all.

Christopher Helt was there for me and won my deportation case.  I was ordered deported and was detained for many months and was going to be deported to my home country.  Mr. Helt stopped my deportation, reopened my case, removed my deportation order and obtained my release.  From that moment on, Mr. Helt was always with me during my saga to legalize my status and stand up for my rights.  HE FOUGHT FOR ME -- for years in the district courts and the immigration courtrooms and in different cities.  I was deported in Los Angeles and Mr. Helt was there for me.  My bond hearing was in Louisiana, and Mr. Helt was there for me.  Mr. Helt was there for me at the Memphis court to help me obtain my lawful permanent residency.  My immigration case was never easy.  Even on the last day of my immigration trial, it was a very contested hearing.   We won and Mr. Helt many times spoke up for me, made numerous objections, protected my rights, made sure that I was treated like a human being and with respect.  And Mr. Helt later represented my wife.  The day before her interview, there was a big snow storm in Chicago and the flights were cancelled.  Mr. Helt left the airport and drove to Memphis overnight (THROUGH A SNOW STORM) so he could be with us at 8:00 a.m. the next morning.  My wife got her green card, thanks to Christopher Helt.  What Mr. Helt did for me and my family was amazing and is superhuman. I can honestly say I don't think there will ever be another lawyer who fights for the South Asian community like Mr. Helt.

Wow, this is the most incredible science museum.  If I had a long layover in Chicago, I would head here all day.  The exhibits are exciting, and the museum is well-done.  The only pain about it is not the most accessible museum via public transportation.  The busses run on an inconsistent schedule.

Last night, all movies in progress shorted out or something. Everyone wandered out with little help or info from staff. My cousin and I waited 20 minutes in the lobby and MANAGEMENT NEVER SHOWED. No announcements, no nothing. I can't help but think that if no one was in charge for this situation, what if there had been a fire, tornado, medical emergency, etc.? I'm so disappointed in the lack of management.

Dr. Gill has been taking care of all my pets for the past 10 years. He's gentle and his staff is amazing. They always know the names of all the pets when they come in to the office. I love that they are personal with everyone. I will always come to this hospital.

I use A Dog's Life for their dog walking services a few times a week. I'm a busy full-time working mom who loves my dog, but there are not enough hours in the day during the work week to take my dog for walks. My dog loves the staff here and has a great time socializing with the other dogs on his walks!

Excellent service and friendly staff. This place deserves 10 stars. It's not everyday that you find a place that cares for your animals almost as well as you do.

The services that Dog's Life on Damen provides to us pet lovers are remarkable. They truly love and care for our pets as if they were their own. My dog loves staying there as much as she loves being at home. Thank you so much for everything.

I appreciate the care and kindness of the staff here.  I like that I have an option to take my dogs for a day of fun and play instead of being at home all the time.  I come at least once a month as a treat for them.  Would recommend.

I have been taking my dog here since he was a puppy and he absolutely loves coming to A Dog's Life.  The day  care is under new management/ownership and have made a lot of improvements, such as extended hours! The best part about this place is that they really understand dog behavior and set up play groups based on age and temperament. They don't discriminate based on breed like a lot of other doggie day cares.  The prices are also really reasonable and the dogs have a really good time. My dog is always nice and tired whenever I pick him up.  The facility is not the prettiest out there but what matters is how well the dogs are taken care of and how knowledgeable/helpful the staff is.  My dog and I both give them 5 stars!

An acquaintance of mine recommended this place as the only place he trusted to take his dogs, so I decided to try it after a few other kennels didn't work out due to the special handling my dog requires.  Now it's the only place I will take Max.  He loves it there and he loves the staff.  It is clean, quiet, and the everyone who works there is knowledgeable and caring.  I would be shocked at the negative reviews if I thought they were accurate, but based on my own experience with this place, they clearly are not. I highly recommend Dog's Life on Damen!

Here's a twist, I take my wife's cats to Dogs Life per her request of course.    We are both big fans of the services provided here.  I know cats can be self-sufficient but we like to think that changing it up a bit promotes a better quality of life for them.  They seem to enjoy it and they look great.

We work with all the employees and they are a delight! Our dog loves them and so do we. Whether I call them a week in advance or 3 hours, they have always come through for us. They are genuinely caring, pleasant and punctual!

This place is truly awesome.  I take Jiminy here once a month, whether it is for grooming services (well that I usually get done every 3 months), but just to provide a fun day for my furry friend since I get so busy and overwhelmed some days.  They have late pick up with works for me.

This is a wonderful, safe, loving environment for any pet. This is the reason I only trust my beloved dog to them. It is so much easier to be gone away when you know that such caring people are taking care of your dog. You don't know the agony I've gone through trying one place after another in the city to find a lot of fighting amongst the animals, dogs getting screamed at all the time, getting squirted with water guns, it's not like that at all here at Dog's Life on Damen, they really care for the dogs. One time, I even saw a person drag a dog using his collar across the room at another place and I left there and never, ever returned again. They can't treat a dog that way and imagine that patrons will actually come back for more. Wow, thank God that doesn't happen here. Friendly, professional people are who you'll find here.

I have been taking my maltipoo here since she was 8 weeks old to get groomed. I recently moved not too far from here but decided to take her to a groomer in my new neighborhood. And let me tell you!

I've never been more comfortable with veterinarian services, Dr Nathan Ranke is the most compassionate, knowledgable, wonderful doctor and I am so lucky to have found him and his entire staff! I bring my 2 dogs and 2 cats to him for all sorts of reasons and by far they receive the best care they've ever had from any facility. Not to mention their very affordable . I have and plan on continuing to recommend them to everyone!

Dr Frederich and His Daughter a vet also and staff are the most caring.  He has been my vet over the years and has many years of experience. Whenever I needed something no mater what time of day he was available to help. He saved our Puppy's life from Parvo virus. God Bless all of them.

I like them because they were local. The owner had a great personality and she was knowledgable about dogs in general and the grooming process. My dog Honey was very comfortable going to the groomer before and after her grooming and she has not always been receptive to groomers before and after her groomings. This was the best she's been groomed. Honey is 3 years old and she has been groomed every month since she was about 10 months. This experience earned "For Dogs Only Grooming Salon" a five star.

Our 2 Maltese's were desperately needing wash/cut in winter. After telling the owner our concern's, we were pleasantly surprised when picking up. We almost didn't recognize them becouse of how good they looked. The owner has been grooming dogs since she was 9 yrs old. I made appointment and called when driving up so they could buzz me right in. Our last groomer closed down, but she actually did a better job.

Brandy is AMAZING! My dog has anxiety...extreme anxiety. But Brandy takes her time with my boys and treats them like people. I've tried several groomers and no one compares. She priced way below what she's worth! One Brandy was unavailable at the time I needed the boys groomed so I took them to a place in West Loop close by our home. They had cute haircuts, but my dog with anxiety had been cut and the cut got infected. I HAVE NEVER HAD THAT ISSUE WITH BRANDY. The boys are always happy to see her, and they come home looking better than when they left.

If your dog is nervous or if you're prone to worrying about how your dog is treated by various pet services, this is an ideal place for dog grooming.  I'm the type of person that is always hovering over my dog, checking to see if he is ok. I have a poodle, and he is a little bit sensitive when his feet are touched and is a lot sensitive when the hair from his ears need to be plucked.On both counts, I HIGHLY recommend Brandy of Dog House of Beauty. I've stood and watched her do her job, and she is patient and gentle. She makes sure that your dog is relaxed at each step of the process before she continues. My dog LOVES going to get groomed, but only at the Dog House of Beauty. He pulls and whines when we get out of the car, desperate to get into the shop. We also use Brandy's boarding services. She walks them four (I think) times a day, and lets the furry guy sleep in her bed! Warning: If your dog has sensitive ears or is prone to ear infections, do NOT GO TO PetSmart. I know from a friend who is a dog groomer there that they are trained to pluck out the ear hairs very quickly, regardless of the pain and discomfort it inflicts. My dog got an ear infection after each of the three times we had him done there, and we would find blood in his ears.  He’s never had an ear infection after visiting the Dog House of Beauty.

The Dog House Of Beauty was a wonderful experience from start to finish. My dog was greeted with great big kiss and was sent on a "treat hunt". Brandy hides treats for the dogs to find in her shop. My dog is such a pig he was in heavenand found every one. He finished his hunt by slopping down some water and plopping himself down in the window with a toy he got from a basket Brandy has for the dogs. He is such a goof !  I left him with Brandy confident he would be very happy. He was done in 1 1/2 hours and when I came to pick him up he was sitting in the window waiting for me.We really like this little shop and would recommend to all dogs.

Gloria is the Best!I have a long haired Dachshund that had been repeatedly been butchered at other so called "Master Groomers*Gloria not only fixed what the last master groomer had done but keeps her looking her absolute best!Gloria has also worked with me on how best to manage her sensitive skin and really she really cares about all my pups! My two boys just love having their nail done by her as well. I highly recommend Gloria!

We were looking for a dog groomer to take really good care of our dog.  She's a chocolate lab and we had taken her to three other groomers in the area, but she came out of them shaking and scared and nervous for several days afterwards, too.  We finally tried the Yuppie Puppy and we couldn't be happier.  The owner and her staff are so nice and enthusiastic and always professional, but what we like most is how much they LOVE our dog.  They let her walk in at her own pace so she's not forced in any way.  The best part is that she now loves to go to the groomer.  She actually turns the corner to go to the groomer and pulls me to get there. We couldn't be happier and we highly recommend the Yuppie Puppy!

I've had nothing but a good experience here. Mark, the property manager has done nothing but go above and beyond. He returns phone calls in a timely manner and if for some reason he isn't able to his assistant Alan does a great job getting back to me. When I email him in the middle of the night, I get a response that night I don't have to wait until the next day to find out what his plan is to address any concern.

I moved into my 2 bedroom a while back and wanted to wait a few months before forming my own opinion! All I have to say is easiest 5 stars I have ever given the manager gets things done, and even installed a fitness room in the building which will save me a trip. The place is great in unit washer dryer, storage in the basement laundry room in the building on top of my in unit washer dryer and a new fitness room this place has been pretty sweet and its near Wrigley which is always a plus.

I own a condo that recently became managed by Kass and was worried at first you never know how these things play out and how the manager that gets assigned to your building will address concerns in the building. But so far everything has been great, Kenny our property has been a great help with getting things done. I am happy that our building made the change to Kass. They definitely take things more serious. Thank you!

I have an apartment managed by Kass and it's an awesome place to be it in Lincoln Park. When I moved in they updated the appliances for me which was such a nice touch, I'm on Armitage which is awesome by 1 bedroom in plenty spacious I have a laundry in the basement with my own storage unit. I have a super responsive property manager so it gives me piece of mind that maintenance request will be done in a timely manner.

I've been renting Kass for a little under a year and have really loved my experience overall.

Prairie Shores Management Company in my opinion is one of the top Management Companies in Chicago land area highly recommended by many Condominium Associations. Over 40 years experience in Condominium property management is the record that only a few can claim. Richard Holtzman is a thru master of he's occupation. What sets Prairie Shores Management apart from others?Customer service, applied knowledge, professional approach and simple solutions to all Condo problems are strength of Mr. Holtzman. Budget projections, lowering big ticket items utilities like gas, electric, water, property taxes, insurance, unnecessary projects, eliminating special interest groups dealing with friends and families, using proper vendors to achieve maximum productivity and common goal for Association while reducing cost across the board. Collections, is a top priority of Mr. Holtzman using proven method and techniques to maximize income and minimize losses.

RPM settled me in Chicago, finding my first place in dead of winter was as smooth as it could ever be. Josh Barr worked with me and walked me through everything necessary and essential to making myself at home in this big city! He has had nothing but respect and great advice from where to eat to what to do to how to maintain. I am so grateful to be a client of Josh we have developed an amazing relationship and I look forward to moving with RPM in the future!

I've been working with Real Property Management ever since I began investing in properties. They have been incredibly helpful from the start, even helping me find new ones, and have been absolutely indispensable with the management of the ones I do own.

I recently got a great offer to transfer to a job overseas, and needed to sell my house. We all know how that is going these days.. BUT, fortunately, my realtor referred me to Real Property Management Chicago and had a lot of great things to say about their services and system. I did some research myself and decided renting would be a better option for me right now. From there, I went with Real Property Management Chicago since they seemed like they really care, are knowledgeable, and they even had good reviews from tenants. Plus, of course, my Realtor referred me to them too so that means something. I've now been with them for six months and have recently been planning to do some more investing in Chicago rental properties because of how good they are.

I hired Real Property Management a few months ago in the middle of an eviction. They stepped in and handled the process for me, which made my days very much less stressful. Now my condo is ready to be rented and I have a tenant moving in at the end of this month! RPM handled everything with the turnover and in getting my unit ready. I am a lot leased stressed about this tenant because I know they have been screened by the professionals at Real Property Management! Thank you for your great service!

I have been with Real Property Management for two years now after firing my first management company. Ever since I hired them to manage my 6 unit building they have done a fantastic job! Sometimes it is not easy to be a landlord in Chicago and if you have limited time like me, it makes being a landlord even more difficult. They handle everything from rent collection to taking calls for needed repairs which makes me 100% satisfied. I would recommend Real Property Management to anyone I know looking for a management company in Chicago. Great service, very professional and very reliable!

Several years ago, I decided to give All Accounting Services a try at helping with filing my income tax.  I had done it myself for years.  Not only did they help me to get a big refund, they redid my previous year's income tax which helped to get even more money back.  I have used them ever since.

Hands down this is the best law firm that I've used. Ms. Mathis and Mr. Carpenter was very helpful throughout the entire case. I mainly was assisted by Ms. Mathis and she was great. Any time I had a question or concern she gave me a clear explanation. Response times were phenomenal. I've never had to sit and wonder if they received my email message or phone call. I'm  still amazed at the service and outcome of my case. I know 5 stars are the max that you can rate  a company but they truly deserve 10+ stars. Thank you again for providing excellent service. I will definitely refer any of my friends/family that's in need of legal assistance to your firm. Continue the great work and I hope you all continue to thrive.

Used these guys to help me with my offer in compromise. They filed tax returns and reduced my back tax debt. I am now in great shape and saved thousands.
 -

First I would like to say that I am completely at fault for falling so far in my back-taxes. I was w-2 then 11 years ago switched to 1099. Needless to say, I couldnt afford my taxes due. I waited and waited but was never able to catch up. One day I was hit with a bank levy and wage garnishment. I called Anderson Bradshaw Conusltants because enough was enough. They stopped the garnishment within two days. It took longer(of course) to completely fix my tax mess, but they did. Completely honest and worth it. definite recommend!!

I am a truck driver and have been for 25 years. For the past 10 years I went without filing my taxes. I have back taxes, a levy, A bank Levy, And my wages were about to be garnished. I called Anderson Bradshaw consultants and within seven hours they stopped my bank levy. And released my wage garnishment. I am on the road to being settled with the IRS and state taxes. Also, I can go back to work without any worry.

I didn't get what I thought I would get when I paid for my daughter's tax case to be handled by this group. She ended up paying as much as she would if we had just done it ourselves. I should have just kept the $3000 I spent with them. Didn't meet expectations they set up front. Not a good experience.

I was a bit nervous at first trusting a company I found online to help me with taxes, but John immediately put me at ease. I owed over $75,000 to the IRS and had a number of missing tax returns and the IRS had already put a wage garnishment on my pay and had just hit my bank account for a sizable chunk of change. Within 24 hours of signing up John put me in touch with an ABC Attorney who got me my money back from the IRS and stopped the wage garnishment. I was kept informed throughout the process and every step was explained to me to make sure I knew what was happening. At the end, I only ended up having to pay the IRS $2,500. I cannot recommend Anderson Bradshaw enough.

I had not filed for 13 years!!!!! I decided to get married so I had to file but didn't have any w-2's or payroll tax information or deductions. Anderson Bradshaw took care of all of that for me. Now I am all caught up on my taxes and it feels great. I didn't even have to do a thing.

I came to Anderson Bradshaw with a $36,000 tax liability. After speaking with Mr. King, he put me in good hands with Josh Kronick. He immediately protected me from IRS Collection action, informed me every step of the way for what to expect from the process, and ultimately delivered me an Offer-in-Compromise that settled my tax burden for $500. I cannot recommend this firm enough. They gave me a fresh lease on life. Thank you!

When we received a letter from the IRS saying my daughter owed them over $18,000 for income in 2013, we nearly had heart attacks! Her U.S. income in that year was only around $5,000, because that was the year she started teaching in Asia. Calls to the IRS gleaned only a little information, but it appeared that an ex of hers had accessed her PayPal account, sold his products online, but not forwarded the information to her nor did he tell her about it. I found Anderson Bradshaw online, contacted them, and after working with Josh and Ted for a short period, they managed to get it all cleared up and proper paperwork filed to clear her of all liabilities. We could not have done it without their help, and I will be eternally appreciative.

I am a United States Navy Veteran, who recently found himself in hot water with IRS . They wanted all these old returns and W-2' s that I haven't seen in years . I called around for help but the tax preparers could only go back 2 years. The other tax firms wouldn't return my call. It was only when I contacted Anderson Bradshaw and spoke to Ted England that I was finally able to get the help that I needed. I am not some rich guy or some huge company ; however, Ted was willing to take the time to get my issue resolved. Thanks to Anderson Bradshaw Tax Consultants I am finally able to get my life back from the IRS.

I was paying the IRS $400 a month for 2 years and I was getting NO WHERE!  When I initially set it up I didn't realize how much they charged for penalties and interest.  It's down right criminal (but that's whole different story) Last summer, things got pretty tough for my wife and I, we were robbing Peter to pay Paul and we just couldn't keep up with the payment any longer.  I had spoke with a few companies a couple years back when all of this started, but they didn't seem like they could offer too much help.  Thankfully I found Anderson Bradshaw through YP and I'm really happy that I did!  I spoke with Ted, he was very patient and answered all of my questions through out the consultation. He explained our options and mapped out a step by step outline of how they were going to resolve our case. There's finally a light at the end of the tunnel for us and they saved us quite a bit of money in the end.  Thank so much for ending this nightmare & getting us that Fresh Start you promised

When I began my search for a tax attorney, it was my understanding  "serve this area" would have been completed in the state I resided.  My paperwork made it across the country from Los Angeles, California to Baltimore, Maryland.  The same paperwork had to be submitted twice, one for each office.   I would have felt more comfortable if the paperwork could have been handled once.   I know that I would have felt more confident  if I could have worked with the same person the whole way through the process.

I cannot recommend ANDERSON BRADSHAW highly enough. There is always a courteous person to answer my questions and I personally work with Bill Davis most all the time. He has dealt with all my inept questions and queries. My account is not completely settled but is moving right along and the results are definitely are meeting my approval! My husband and I had ourselves in a real mess and they are getting things worked out really well. If you have any doubts about this company...don't hesitate to HIRE THEM ASAP!

I'm happy to write this review. I called ABC Tax two months ago when the IRS put a lien on my home and levied my wages. I was in $85,000 in debt to the IRS from when I started my own business many years ago. I never made any money in that business and now the IRS is threatening to take everything I have. As soon as I was transferred to Jeff, he put my mind at ease.  He is very knowledgable about tax help and tax resolution. He told me that he can stop the levy that day. and that I could settle my tax bill for only 5k. You guys did what you promised and now that I am paying back my reduced amount, The irs is removing the lien on my home and now I have a fresh start.

These guys got the lien removed on my bank account in one day, and set up payments to the IRS that I could afford. Thanks, A-B!

My wife works as independent contractor and we got careless about quarterly deposits so after about 2 years we owed way too much. We looked around and this guy calmed us down and was able to get us some kind of compromise with the IRS  and payments that we can now afford. yes, we recommend them.

A tax preparer whom I have worked with for years turned out to be stealing from me. Michelle Moya Pearl stole my stimulus money, opened fraudulent accounts using my identity, and screwed me on my latest tax return when I began connecting the dots. Absolutely scandalous, this company is well aware of her wrong doings. Don't trust these people with your information or money.

Being legally bound to financial jargons all my life, I faced some tax evasion issues last year where I was going to be rendered superfluous by the court if they had acquitted me. Even though I was right in my own terms, with the help of OMG Tax, they efficiently discovered the fissures in the data I kept. It was truly an astounding experience.

Coral Gables Plumbing Co is the best! My fiance and I had been burned by another plumber that ended up causing a leak in our condo, so off I went doing extensive research for the right company. Coral Gables Plumbing Co was not only very professional in their assessment and resolution of our plumbing problem, but their customer service is second to none! They could/should teach classes on the subject. Their technician was very thorough and left nothing to chance, in addition to being courteous and clean (drop clothes were used and everything was left clean). Needless to say, we'll be recommending them to everyone in our building (I've called to request business cards). Thank you for the peace of mind Coral Gables Plumbing!

We were doing a huge add on to our home and needed a dependable plumbing company.  I had used various other companies for my business needs in the past, but was usually disappointed.  I tried out Coral Gables Pluming and would definately say they are better than the others out there.  Brandon was extrremely knowledgable, up front, and gave me an honest assment of what I needed.  I'd bet  a dollar to a hole in a donut there isn't a better plumbing company out there in south Florida.  I think the other companies kind of fiddle about and hope to luck box into a viable solution.  Not CGP.

I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the staff at CGP, they did an awesome job on my bathrooms!!! Thanks guys!I'd also like to recommend this company and most importantly the team.  There are many plumbing compaines around but very few that still provide the kind of service this one does!  They followed through and delivered on what they promised!  I've had nothing but wonderful compliments on my bathrooms :)

Over the years I have tried different plumbing companies and I’m so glad I’ve finally found one that knows the meaning of true customer service! These guys have been in business for a very long time and it shows. It’s nice to be able to work with a family and son owned company. I would recommend Coral Gables Plumbing to all my family and friends.

These guys really know what they are doing. I was very impressed at the excellent customer service and plumbing knowledge. I was interested in remodeling one of my bathrooms so I went into their show room and wow, what an excellent selection of products they have. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. They were able to work with my budget too. Once the remodel started I was afraid of the mess it was going to make but all off the staff were very clean, they even wore booties to cover their shoes! The final product is incredible and I am so pleased with my new bathroom. I will be a life long customer of Coral Gables Plumbing!

When I was in need of a plumber I was a bit hesitant to go for the cheapest I had been burned in the past so I went with one that was a bit more. Not the most expensive but mid range. To make a long story short I was amazed the work was done quickly, and the wow factor was that the plumber after introducing himself placed shoe covers before entering the house. Usually you think of a plumber as a nasty guy taking your money and leaving a mess. Coral gables plumbing is my plumbing company FROM NOW ON

I was impressed by the customer service and knowlege that coral gables plumbing has,  I've been to other places and received several quotes on my remodels, cora gables plumbing was the only company that I received any customer service. I was truly lost before I came to this store. There showroom tubs,showers and even sinks are working, the only place were i could see and feel the way the tubs and every thing works before I even purchased it. It was a wonderful experience working with this company,  one stop shop truly. The plumbing service in town.

CGP did all of the concepts and the designs for the seven bathrooms in my dream house. They gave me the most current and jaw dropping bathrooms. Brandon in sales was particularly helpful and Rick, the owner gave me an incredible price, just north of wholesale. They were clean, polite and efficent. All of my other subs could learn some lessons from them. You won't go wrong with CGP weather your job is big or small. Good Luck!!

They were extremely knowledgeable and helped me through the very last detail.I highly recommend them for you next project:)Yani

WOW!  We have used these folks service for years and they just keep getting more knowledgeable!  They are professional and dependable and know the most current ways to repair things.  We have also used them as a resource for remodeling our bathroom and laundry area and I could never have been as satisfied with the end result if they had not helped with my selections!  Trust these folks for anything you need!

Hello to Coral Gables Plumbing. I do not usually write on online sites but we have been so excited about the remodeling and additions of our kitchen, bathrooms, bath / spa house and patio bar area. Our home is now complete! The advise, office help and attention to detail made our many decisions easier. We searched many places before we found the most complete selections with the best prices. The fine work that Coral Gables Plumbing completed will be shown in Living Modern. It was a pleasure to work with an honest father and son team and staff.

This professional company did all the plumbing in my new home and I cant say enough.  The quality, professionalism, and timely performance where very impressive.  I have used them on numerous other jobs with the same results.

This review sure sounds like it came from a disgruntled employee, if you ask me. I have dealt with Coral Gables over the past 10 years and have always been incredibly satisfied.  The staff at Coral Gables are always up to date and extremely knowledgeable about the products they offer. I have dealt with a bunch of other plumbing companies over the years and it's true, you sure do get what you pay for. Coral Gables prices are very reasonable and the service that comes along with the price is priceless. I would definitely recommend Coral Gables Plumbing to all my friends and family.

I recently called Coral Gables Plumbing for a toilet clogged. The technician explained that our toilet was an older model using over 7 gallons per flush. He then recomeneded a Toto toilety which not only saves water, but also gives me a $100.00 check from miami Dade Water and sewer. Coral Gables Plumbing had the toilet instock and had it installed within an hour. They were neat and clean and fair with the price.

I called American Drain for a second opinion on work that i was going to have done at my home this week coming up, i will not say the name of the company but its one of the largest plumbing company in the nation. i was told by the plumber that came out that i need to have my sewer line replaced from my house to the road, at a cost of 9800.00 dollars. i paid almost 400 dollars just to have them clear it they then put a camera in line and they told me that the line was full of roots and was broken and it needed to be changed, being that this is a national company i trusted what they told me. i did not have all the money so i had to get a loan for the repairs, they wanted to start the job right away and they kept insisting that it needed to be done now. thank  god it took me a week to get this loan, while waiting i did some research on line and found American drain co. they gave free second opinions so i figured i have nothing to lose. to make i long story  short i had no roots and my line was in perfect condition. THIS NATIONAL PLUMBING COMPANY WAS GOING TO TAKE ME FOR ALMOST 10 THOUSAND DOLLARS. Thanks to Jose  at American for saving my Holidays. I will be filing a complaint with the BBB on this RIP OFF COMPANY.

Called them Yesterday Had a big Problem at my house with friends watching the game. i expected to pay through the roof. Not the case, paid what they told me was the standard flat rate. paid 185.00 to unclog my whole house and on top of that they checked the pipes with a special little camera . very satisfied with this company. my neighbor told me that a couple weeks ago he paid roto rooter 349.00 to have the same thing done. that really made me glad i called American drain first.

Very Good company, fair price will use them again when i have a plumbing problem.Roto Rooter wanted 400.00 Dollars to clear my drains, these people only charged me 185.00 with a six month warranty, and checked my line for free with a video machine.

I had a problem last week called 4 local plumbers. i needed my line snaked out, nothing in the house was working toilets showers etc,  the funny thing isthat out of the four only one gave me a 3 hour window it was this company American Drain co. the others said that they would have some one out within the hour, and they did have some one at my door in about an hour, no one wanted to give an over the phone estimate just to get an idea of what it was going to set me back. only American gave me a ball park figure over the phone, one Rooter company wanted 349 to clear the line when i said no he dropped the price to 299 still to high. the other guy wanted 250 getting better but then told me that there was a service fee which brought it up to 280.i had been quoted over the phone by American about 185 so i figured i would want for them if i am able to save 100 bucks or so. they showed up within the window i was given and was told that it would be 185 to have my line cleared. they did the work saved 150 dollars got a nice warranty. worth the wait  waited an extra hour and a half to save 150 dollars that's not a bad deal. Thanks

I just had to write about this company, my mother who is 87 called this company, she's lives by herself and is on a very restricted income, she called and got a quote over the phone for a clogged toilet.  when she told me that she was waiting for a service man to fix her toilet i jumped in the car and rushed over, she had been taken advantage in the past on service work for her home, and i was not about to let it happen again. when i got there a gentleman was there he told me that his name was Jose, he told me that he was not far away and that all he did was plunge the toilet to clear it. he said he was not even going to charge my mother, he was around the corner and it only took him 5 minutes to fix the toilet, what a nice thing to do i was shocked that there are still descent people in the service industries,  i will recommend this company to all my friends and coworkers thank you so much for the kind gesture.

After calling around for a reasonable price to clean my house drains, this company was one of the least expensive so i figure i would give them a try, glad i did the guy that they sent out was a well experienced plumber. i could tell just buy the way he worked and explained everything to me and the tools he had and used, very professional. i got my drains cleaned and was even show the condition of the drains inside after he cleaned them with camera that he put in to the pipes.  payed a third less of what Roto Rooter quoted me to clean my drains. VERY Happy

I called one of the large nation wide Rooter Companies for a problem with my home sewer, the charge was $350.00 just to clear the line, i was disparate it was late Friday and i had guest coming over for dinner, so i went ahead and payed. the next day the line clogged again i call the Rooter company back ,, they sent out a second guy not the first he wanted to charge me another 350 i told him that i had just paid last night 350 and i was told i had a 6 month warranty, he told me that this was not the same problem and that i would have to pay again, after about an hour of going back and forth and unable to speak to a supervisor i asked him to leave i went back on line and looked for an other company, thank goodness i found  American Drain. they came right out and showed me exactly what the problem was after he cleared the line he put in a camera, it was clear that the first Rooter Guy did not clear the line properly. American ran a jet machine and clean it to a tee charged me less than half what i was charged by the rip off rooter company. i will never use that Rooter Company again. if you have any type of drain problems call American Drain  very fare and honest up front no BS. Thanks again. Oh but the way i have asked for a full refund from that Rooter Joker. and reported them to the BBB

Joe M. (tech #3633) came to our home to help us with a clogged guest toilet. He arrived in record time which was a relief considering it we had family over for my daughter's birthday. Joe was professional and courteous, and he completed his work efficiently and effectively and 100% resolved our issue. For any plumbing issues in the future, I'm definitely going to call Roto Rooter, and hope I get Joe!

Denzil Richards(tech#595) came out to my home. He was professional, polite and pleasant. He listened and advised of two methods that would help along with the difference between the price and why. He spoke to me about monthly maintenance on my drains (who knew your supposed to do that) and had a great disposition even making sure my dogs felt comfortable about his being here. I have nothing negative to say about my experience with both the company and the quality of service I received with Denzil. I hope I never need Roto Roofer again for anything but the maintenance product refill but if I do, I will definitely call back. PS the only reason the promptness was not rated 5 was traffic related from his last assignment.

My son decided to throw a very small toy down the toilet and thankfully I found joe montalbanco 3633 from roto rooter to look at it and fix our problem. He was really professional and helpful helping us solve our problem.

From the beginning they were super helpful. While I was waiting for the tech, a Restoration Rep, Jessica-5965, came to my home to assist until the tech showed up. She was extremely professional,  and without her expertise I would have never realized how extensive the damage was, which saved me health issues from mold and costly out of pocket expenses later. She dealt directly with my insurance company and went above and beyond what she was required. She is very easy to contact and has been in touch with me the whole way. I must also mention that the techs Demetrios-1229 , as well as Jeremy-1322 and Felton-2418 were prompt, professional, and handled the job quickly and neatly. Overall  they have made a very stressful situation manageable.
 -

This is why I call a professional: expert service, knowledgeable, pleasant attitude. Dennis did the job (leaking water from corroded tank bolts) quickly and neatly and I would certainly call upon again when needed.

We discovered a wall slab pipe leakage last night and Roto Rooter sent someone out within the hour, the agent assessed the issue  and scheduled another technician for us the next morning who specialized in our problem. Roto Rooter sent Angel #696, he was very knowledgeable, professional and honest on his evaluation and fixed our issue  with the hour. We look forward to continuing to work with Angel and Roto Rooter in the future, thank you

I was able to schedule easily online and get a same day appointment. They called ahead to let me know the Eddie the tech was on his way. Eddie arrived on time and was extremely professional. My tub was cleared in no time. Hope to not need their services again, but if I do I will be using them again.

Hire these guys!  Don't think twice about it.  I've done a lot of research and hired others before I found this company.  I'm very pleased that I did.  There was a minor glitch, (Not related to the work they did) which they came back and addressed immediately. Their number and all contact information are plastered on the wall next to the new water heater. Thank you, Carlos!

Carlos is reliable and extremely honest and ethical.  He went out to look at a water heater at a new house that we were purchasing.  He could have easily sold us a new unit and housing and instead chose to tell us that the current set up was fine and we should leave as is.  I highly recommend this company and will refer him to all of our family and friends.

Why Marlow' s Plumming over any other plumming company? There are plummers and there are master plummers and that is Marlow's Plumming. I just experienced the aftermath of Irma on my condo. 2 floors with 2 baths and a half 3 toilets and nothing worked!!!!!!!!  After calling 2 plumming companies and wasting money that literally went down the drain I found Marlows Plumming who solved the huge problem as he came in like a doctor know how to repair a heart of a home. I would recommend Marlow's Plumming to any home owner or commercial company who wants superior service and excellent knowledge of skilled plummers. A a rare find in the state of Miami,FL.

I called several plumbing companies for an estimate on redoing my master bath and replace a gas water heater. The only people that showed up to my house was Luis, the owner. Gave me a free quote with alot of remodeling ideas for the plumbing that i never dremt of. At the end of the day I had a drawing and a price and decided to roll with it. The company and its employees are very proffessional, courteous, and "Clean".Well, to make along story short.... I ended up with and incredible bathroom, a new gas tankless water heater and a rebate in which they got me back $500.00 for the gas water heater and fixed my water pressure that my wife was complaining about for years....Reliable, clean, on time....;)

They got here exactly at the time they had told me, they came straight to do their job, cleaned up after themselves and did not leave anything out of order. i did not have to check up on them to make sure the job was getting done because they seemed to know what they were doing. i will be recommending them to all my friends and family and anyone in the south Florida area.

I want to thank God for giving me the opportunity of finding a criminal lawyer to represent my son who is not only professional but an extraordinary human being. From the beginning of my journey with Mr. Petruzzi and his staff, I felt I was in good hands. They were always attentive in answering my phone calls, emails, meetings and most importantly serving all my sons legal matters since his arrest. We were provided with guidance along the way, which gave us a sense of comfort and positive thinking. Mr. Petruzzi and staff really go out of their way to attend your legal needs, even on days I would arrive without a scheduled appointment. I’m truly grateful for having the opportunity to work with Mr. Petruzzi and achieving an excellent result to my son’s federal criminal case. Mr. Petruzzi assisted my son and family tremendously by reducing his sentence to the utmost minimum in regards to credit card fraud and for that I am truly grateful and beyond happy with his legal services. Thank you to The Law Offices of Paul D. Petruzzi.

Paul is an excellent attorney. I highly recommend him for criminal defense matters. Him and his staff, (Johevis, Cristy, Beatriz and Mauricio) are all very responsive, knowledgeable, experienced, and geniuanly willing to help. In our first meeting I was very nervous but he made me feel very comfortable, as if I was talking to a friend or mentor who I can go to for helpful advice. I can't thank you enough guys.
 -

Hiring Mr Paul Petruzzi as my attorney to deal with my case was the best decision that I could ever do. He was always awailable and informative through the entire process. It was a huge pleasure to work with him due to his friendliness and in the same time the professionalism that he showed. I would gladly recommend him. Paul Petruzzi is the best!!!
 - 
 -

 - 
The staff is incredible in directing your particular situation to Mr. Petruzzi. When you get to sit down with Paul, you will immediately feel as though you are speaking to a friend.  By no means will you get the run around or the regular "lawyer talk" he will be upfront with you let you know all possible outcomes and occurrences and let you sit back and make the intelligent decision for yourself.  I have been a client for 6 years and have referred friends and loved ones to him and will continue to do so in the future.

I never thought I could ever land myself into legal trouble, but it happened. I didn't know what to do and I was without legal representation. A friend recommended I call Paul Petruzzi and I'm glad I did. Mr. Petruzzi gave me peace of mind and assured me that all would be taken care of. Mr. Petruzzi got my case dismissed. I highly recommend him to anyone for any legal need.

i am profoundly grateful that Paul Petruzzi has graced my family and helped  my fiance in beating a federal case. He and his investigator are absolutely brilliant and genius at what they do. i would recommend him to anyone with any case on any level. i guarantee it. he is also affordable! Tell him Sarah sent you!
 - 
 -

 - 
Iam so thankful that I chose Paul Petruzzii as my lawyer. I can't say that my case would've gotten dismissed if I had chosen another lawyer. My case was dismissed after his excellent private investigator dug up some ground breaking facts on the so called witness/victim so they threw out all his statements and claims. He also had done a deposition/interrogation on the witness/interrogation which had revealed that he was lying straight through his teeth. I highly recommend Paul Petruzzi and his professional team. I am so happy that I can finally move on with my life and leave this in the past.

I  can't even give then a half star. I  made the conclusion that they are close or don't answer any call on Monday or Tuesday.  The waiting music is depressing.

A computer answers the telephone, tells you they have high call volume right now, please call back later, then hangs up on you.  For a solid week.

I contacted this attorney over the phone regarding sexual assault/malpractice case from a proctologist. The first question he asked me was "do you mind if I ask...are you black?" When asked, Mr. Friedman admitted that had I been a white woman, he'd be interested in representing me. It's not him mind you, he claims that this is the way the system is set up and a judge would not be sympathetic towards me (a black man). He discouraged me from from filing a report or taking action of any kind. Hope you understand what kind of people you're dealing with if you decide to contact them///

My own true experience: On the week of Feb 13, 2012, I had a consultation with an attorney at this firm (I'll refrain from naming him). Even though I was well-prepared and concise as I explained my case (being mindful not to waste his time), I experienced several instances where he rudely interrupted, even ridiculed, me and my case. If he was not interested, I would have gladly accepted him plainly saying so. Instead, he resorted to abusive tactics just to sway me to redirect my desire for legal representation elsewhere. I wrote this because I sincerely hope the same does not happen to you. Thank you.

Attorney Lisa A. Baird plus her assistant Barbara and other staff members are amazing. If I could give more stars I would!!!!!My case was special and not very pleasant from the start. Ms. Baird and staff kept me constantly updated and pushed to keep my case moving forward even when faced with potential setbacks and complications. Overall I’m thankful for her guidance, dedication, professionalism and knowledge of the divorce court process. Attorney Baird and staff more than exceed my divorce expectations.

Mrs. Baird and her staff are incredible professionals and wonderful human beings. Lisa is an excellent family law professional, who goes above and beyond her hired duties to make sure the client has positive case results. She is extremely knowledgeable, accurate, fair, while being compassionate and caring. She delivers on her promises because she KNOWS how to obtain what is rightfully yours. Barbara, her legal assistant is just as wonderful as a professional and a person.I recommend Lisa Baird and her team 100% to anyone who wants the truth and justice. I will be forever indebted to her, because she was able to deliver more than expected, and restore peace in my life.

If there were 10 stars, that is exactly what I would rate Attorney Lisa A. Baird. We battled a (not so pleasant) divorce for 2 years. Initially, the wife was requesting alimony, 80/20 parenting due to her needs for more child support, not an equitable distribution of debt and assets including the home. We started with a different attorney and our first mediation was a complete nightmare. After that mediation, we decided to change attorneys and hired Lisa. She and her staff, dissected through all of the financials, researched the various laws applied per issue, and got to work. Lisa and her team work very hard to get to know their client's situation. They are humble, fair, and know how to use the laws accordingly. I am truly blessed to have come across this amazing team. My final outcome, agreement signed at mediation #2. No alimony, equitable distribution of marital home upon sale, each party responsible for their own debt, each party responsible for own legal fees, $450 a month for 3 years only for child support, equal distribution of 401 K balances. We are beyond grateful! There are many attorney's out there that are not about the best interest of their client. Lisa and her team become part of your family. Thank you, thank you, thank you and God bless.

Lisa Baird recently represented me in a high conflict divorce and did a superb job in doing so.  The outcome was beyond my expectations.  She is a real professional.  And if she can do it, she makes every effort to get it done for you, always going above and beyond.  I was an extremely satisfied customer and would highly recommend to anyone seeking a divorce attorney.

Lisa Baird and her team helped me enormously not only in handling all the legal requirements for paperwork, but more importantly to set us back on the right path when negotiations were stalling on 1-2 items. Because of her confidence in her knowledge on how other cases are being handled, she was able to clear up any misconceptions the opposing counsel had. Thank you Lisa!

She was a rockstar. Her and her team are kind and professional. Answered all my questions and put my doubts to rest. My ex wife and I wanted to get a divorce she was demanding not only child support but alimony which I couldn’t afford. So I went looking for a divorce and child support lawyer when we went our separate ways...Lisa was not only fair but a force to be reckon with in court. She answered all my questions in a timely manner and was also divorced in a timely matter as well.  If I ever have such an issue again, I will gladly use her service once again and definitely recommend her!! Oh and she works with you on payment plan for her fees which was a great relief to me!!

Lisa Baird has been the greatest lawyer in family court compared to other lawyers in the Miami area. She is very devoted to her cases and plans every detail with expertise. She has helped me in a very disastrous divorce and also in child parenting plans. Shes very honest and forward with your case and will give you the best advise on how to handle any family court situation. With her dedication and vast knowledge I have recommended her to several of my close friends for proper guidance. Due to her extreme commitment if any future situations arise Lisa Baird is the first lawyer I would seek to handle any case. No situation is too complicated for her to take on and succeed.

I hired Ms. Lisa Baird a couple of times and I couldn't have been happier with the final result and the professionalism with which Ms. Baird handled my situation and by the way the price was very reasonable compared with what comparable lawyers charge in that area of practice. I strongly recommend Ms. Baird to any one who has family or divorce situations to deal with

Lisa Baird represented me in a very difficult two year custody battle involving two children and a very complicated case that started out in two states. Opposing party and the initial hearing judge wanted the case moved out of FL, contrary to the law. Lisa was able to stick to her guns and forced the court to uphold the law and keep the case in FL, saving me considerable expenses not having to hire two teams of attorneys in two states. She then systematically picked apart the opposing party’s case line by line, proving their case was nothing but complete falsehoods.  She’s very aggressive and an excellent strategist. When she learned all about my case, she devised a specific path for us to pursue and remained focused on it. I couldn’t be more grateful to her and her team for the professionalism and knowledge of family case law they displayed, and in the end we were able to not only win the case, but we got just about everything we initially set out to obtain and she was able to prevent the case from becoming what would have surely been an expensive and lengthy trial. That being said, even the best attorneys do not know your individual case as well as you do without you providing as much detailed information as possible. Even items I thought were irrelevant she was able to show were actually very important for my case. I’ve tried to talk her into branching out into other areas of the law, but she prefers to remain focused as an expert in family case law. I would highly recommend Lisa and her team in a heartbeat.  My ex that lost the case against Lisa even recommended Lisa to someone she knew over her own attorney! That says it all.

After going through a difficult civil litigation, I realized I needed an attorney to help me navigate through the system.  I did a LOT of research reading reviews and narrowed my search to the 3 best attorneys in Miami.  I went and did an in-person meeting with all 3 and decided James was the best fit.  I would call his law firm the "Goldilocks" of firms - not too big, not too small....just the right size.  He knows his specialty incredibly well, very experienced and really listened to my case.  I didn't feel like a "number" and received great service.  Hiring James was one of the best business decisions I've made in years.   I highly recommend him.

Mr. Poe is the best attorney anyone could ever have. He's kind, thoughtful  and understanding. When I first called him I was so stressed and worried but from the moment I first met with him until my Modification was approved I was at ease that I had made the right choice. They always treated me with courtesy and respect and for that I am forever grateful. His secretary , Yenny, was always quick to respond  to my questions and give updates in the case.  Everything was done in a timely manner, and I will recommend !Mr. Poe to my family, friends and to anyone who needs his expertise.

highly recommend Mr. Poe to anyone looking for a great lawyer to solve their needs. I visited seven lawyers before working with Mr. Poe and decided to go meet him based on a great referral from a friend. He was everything I was told to be. Since day one to six years later when my case closed, his services were excellent. The legal assistant ( Priscilla and Jenny)and office manager Carlos Hernandez, are also very pleasant to work with, always ready to help and very professional. Mr. Poe was a true blessing in my case and I am so grateful for all of his effort and dedication. Thanks everyone for all you help!!!Mireya Olmo-Rodriguez

This office saved my family. I left this review on another link for this office where there are only 3 reviews. I only found this page because Don610 added a link so I am adding a link back sagger my review so others can add their reviews there. Hopefully the Yellow Pages will combine the two. This office saved my family. When creditors are harassing you and your family and you know you're in trouble, it's hard to ask  for a referral to a good bankruptcy attorney but it's also a gamble to just pick one at random. I swallowed my pride and asked a coworker I knew had successfully done a bankruptcy. He recommended me to James Alan Poe. Mr. Poe and his staff are great. Having 14 years experience they know your worries before you do and help to ease your anxiety and certainly the stress, as they help to navigate you through the bankruptcy process. At one point I felt overwhelmed and Mr. Poe told me he eats elephants one bite at a time. He gave me a laugh and made me realize it was a process that others have done and I too could manage.  I  have already recommended  this firm and would do so again to anyone who needs help, but isn't  sure if bankruptcy is the way to go.http://www.yellowpages.com/miami-fl/mip/law-office-of-james-alan-poe-3678124/reviews?lid=3678124

This is a link to my original review and many others.http://www.yellowpages.com/miami-fl/mip/law-offices-of-james-alan-poe-pa-452106799/reviews?lid=452106799I don't understand why YP doesn't have all reviews together.I never thought I would have to claim bankruptcy. If you asked friends and family they would say never in a million years. I was good about money, saving here and there. Then an illness changed everything. When it's your kid nothing else matters. My savings went faster than sand through your fingers- I borrowed money from my family. I used credit cards to pay for basic necessities and I was drowning in debt. Two years of this before I realized I couldn't go on like this. My phone was ringing constantly with bill collectors, I was receiving letters daily.Mr. Poe was very helpful to me. I came into his office on a friend's recommendation.I mentioned the family's name and right away he remembered them. We talked and he explained that this wasn't my fault. I felt such relief when he said this and looked over some information I supplied and told me I qualified for bankruptcy relief. I was nervous but the toughest part was gathering my paperwork. I just received notice that my case is over. I am grateful to Mr. Poe and his staff.(His office manager is hilarious and helped to lighten my mood)Now I plan on taking things one day at a time. Starting over may seem scary but to me it's a fresh start. One I needed and one that was made easier by this office.I am happy to recommend Mr. Poe if anyone should need to hear from me personally.Regards,Don

Fantastic! Mr. Poe has worked his fingers to the bone for me. I came to him with a lot of problems. I was unsure if I would be able to afford to hire an attorney and I explained this to him after telling him about my situation. He charged me a flat fee and has worked for a year for this fee. We've sorted through everything now and I feel good recommending him to others. I was recommended to him by a friend of mine and I will do the same.He is located near Dadeland mall and I used the metro rail to get to and from his office. Very simple and I didn't get stuck in traffic.On a few occasions Mr. Poe and a staff member stayed late to meet me when I ran late due to my work commitments. I definitely felt that I was in good hands.Thank you Mr. Poe.

I vsited various attorneys and decided to go with Mr. Poe. I felt very comfortable with his attention and with his staff. At a time when I was uncertain of what to expect, they were able to guide me in the right direction. When ever I had a question which pertained to my chapter 13 or the foreclosure proceedings. I always received a call back in a timely matter. I highly recomend working with Mr. Poe, Carlos, and Nadine.

After visiting several attorneys I felt confortable with Mr. Poe and his staff. The one on one attention I received in this horrible experience helped me get through.

Mr. Poe was very kind. He helped us when things were very bad and stress was taking over our lives. There is a light at the end of the tunnel and finding this office and receiving the help we did was the first step in getting out of the darkness. My family is better now. Things are much better. We have finished out bankruptcy, and my husband and I feel good to have chosen to do it. We were weary at first but it was the right choice for our family. Thank you Mr. Poe. And Ms. Nadine, you were so helpful too.

When I was injured at work, I was incapable of working for nearly a year. The Farber Law firm not only handled my Workers Comp Claim, but also investigated further to find liability with the location i sustained my injury. As a result, David went above and beyond to make sure that a personal injury claim was filed. In a time where day to day activities were overwhelming, David, Helen and Maria guided me through the process, eliminating any anxiety I had. This allowed me to focus on what was important, getting better for me and my children. David walked me through my deposition and fought hard to maximize my settlement, which was more than I thought I could get. His law firm is the epitome of quality and dedication to those they represent. I never felt like my case was small. David made me feel important, which is why I am happy to recommend him to others.

I can't remember where I first saw Idalis's name but I do remember her outstanding reviews convinced me and my husband to go with her as our counsel. I'm very glad I did. Idalis and her team, because it's a team effort, with a special shout out to Idalmis (her sister who's the the COO to her CEO) Got the process going, kept it going, took care of every little detail, was very responsive to questions and concerns (even if I asked like the same thing probably five times). And kept checking in . Immigration issues always carry some stress. Knowing they were there for us took a huge weight off our shoulders. They weren't perfect there were a couple of glitches (most notably a form that didn't get filed as fast as it should of due to a teammembers medical issue that caused it to be overlooked for a few days.) But with the good communication back and forth, once the problem was identified it was immediately expedited and taken care of. To me seeing how a team handles a problem is a better indication of how good they are as opposed to when everything is running totally smoothly. Seeing them handle the problem so quickly and efficiently after recognizing it gave me more confidence that if something went wrong they would have it cleared up ASAP. So If you want a warm and friendly, and caring staff (the second time I sat with Idalmis she asked about my mother-in-law's health, which had been fragile at the time of initial meeting. Her concern was genuine and I was touched she remembered and asked me about it - luckily she was much better). Who is also experienced, diligent and effective. I absolutely recommend Idalis Perez and her excellent team.

I recommend Idalis Perez.Pedirle a la abogada Idalis Perez que represente a mis dos menores hijos en un complicado caso de ajuste de status es una de las mejores decisiones que he tomado en mi vida. El caso de mis hijos tomó un giro inesperado y problemático una noche que oficiales de inmigración visitaron mi domicilio, luego de esa visita quedé desmoralizado y casi sin esperanzas, sinceramente me hacía de regreso en mi país con mis hijos. Antes de visitar a la abogada Idalis Perez me entrevisté con dos abogados mas, honestamente no me convencieron, a pesar de ser muy "conocidos" en el medio no me inspiraron confianza. Todo lo contrario sucedió al entrevistarme con Idalis, sobria en su análisis de la situación, sincera al darme su opinión, absolutamente entendida en las leyes de inmigración y los pasos a seguir. Idalis estableció una estrategia y esa estrategia nos llevó a un final feliz, hoy mis hijos son residentes permanentes. A lo largo del camino Idalis nos nos mantuvo informados, absolvió todas nuestras dudas, siempre estuvo ahí para nosotros, si hubieran 10 estrellas en vez de 5 para calificar su conocimiento de las leyes, su trato humano , su honestidad y su disponibilidad para atender mis dudas o preocupaciones con gusto le daría 10 estrellas. Quiero hacer una mención muy especial al staff de Idalis, todos ellos se han portado maravillosamente con nosotros, han sido eficientes, atentos, muy pero muy pacientes con un padre preocupado del futuro de sus hijos, realmente son el equipo que toda persona que se enfrenta a un complicado caso de inmigración sueña tener. Hoy que hemos superado existosamente el complicado camino que la vida nos puso por delante quiero agradecer a Idalis y su staff, sin ellos no lo hubiéramos logrado y quiero que mi experiencia sirva a los que vienen detrás. Los casos de inmigración afectan las vidas de las personas, al confiarle un caso de inmigración practicamente estamos confiando nuestro futuro al abogado que escojamos, haberle confiado a Idalis el caso de inmigración y por ende el futuro de mis hijos fue la mejor decisión que pude tomar. Una vez mas y no me cansaré de repetirlo Gracias Idalis!

I am beyond satisfied with the firm. The professionalism is top-notch. You are constantly updated on how your case is going and can always speak to someone who can help you should you have any concerns. I always knew what to expect next and was given realistic expectations. This was truly a smooth and stress-free process. I have been spreading the word to family and friends even prior to my case being settled.

Jason Neufeld was very helpful with my husband's case. He met with us and explained the whole process. He was very quick with email responses and always answered all our questions. The advice he gave showed his concern for us. He cares and most of the times we felt like we were his only clients. Which was very important and made us very comfortable. My husband and I would highly recommend him.

I just felt incredibly taken care of. I didn't have to worry about how the case was progressing. Whenever I had a question, Jason would pick up immediately or call me back within a day or so. The result was great - more than I expected. Thank you to Jason and his staff for a job well done.

Alan and Jason Neufeld saved me! If you have been in an accident and want to get help from a REAL attorney - someone who REALLY CARES and makes sure that you are respected and heard - call Neufeld Kleinberg and Pinkiert - ask for ALAN OR JASON.

I am so happy that Neufeld, Kleinberg and Pinkiert worked on my case. The partners really cared about making sure I understood everything every step of the way and also cared about my personal situation as well, since I sustained major injuries. They worked very hard to make sure all my (insane) medical bills were paid and also managed to get compensation for the injuries I sustained since I had to quit my job as a result. I am forever grateful for them.

Our family was represented by the sharpest legal mind in all of Florida, Jason Neufeld. Jason Neufeld was not only our attorney during a very difficult time, but he treated us like family. Jason is truly a dynamic personal injury attorney, second to none,  and he  connects with you and your entire family in a way other attorneys cannot. We would never go to any other Attorney from this point on, other han with Jason Neufeld at Neufeld, Kleinberg, and Pinkiert. He stood by us during a very vulnerable time, but with his steady hand, knowledge, expertise, and professional demeanor, helped us become whole again. Thank you Jason, we will always be grateful!And I have to add one more as I almost forgot. Jason was referred to us by family members, even though, as husband and wife, we already worked with and had our own personal injury attorneys. Because what we heard about Jason was so amazing,  like he was "one in a million," we decided to give him a try.... and he really is everything and beyond. It was the Best decision we ever made, and as a family, WE refer Jason Neufeld to all other families, because you will not be disappointed.We are, as said before, grateful, and honored to have Jason as our new family attorney.Sincerely, Lisa, Khalil, and Davien.

I am always hesitant when it comes to attorneys. I was referred to Jason Neufeld by several mutual friends and still was not trusting him completely in the beginning. I've heard so many stories about attorneys taking advantage of clients and since I don't understand the law myself, I felt going in blind, having to completely rely on him and his work ethics. To my surprise, Jason easily addressed any of the questions I've asked him and trust issue disappeared after few weeks. Now, when everything in done, I can say that it was definitely my best legal experience so far! He has a combination of the business drive and human element that allow him to provide the clients with the best representation possible! I can say that out of all attorneys I trust him 100%!

As an attorney myself, I am very critical of other attorneys.  Jason Neufeld and the staff of Neufeld, Kleinberg & Pinkiert have consistently provided excellent results in my recent suits.  They exhibit the utmost professionalism, and provide timely updates as to case progress.  I am very satisfied with the results I received from this firm.  I highly recommend Neufeld, Kleinberg, & Pinkiert to anyone searching for trustworthy, fair and reliable legal representation.

After extensive research, we picked Lipcon, Margulies & Winkleman, P.A. to represent us in our maritime lawsuit. We were exceptionally fortunate to have Attorney Alex Perez and his team, particularly Kim Cuellar, advocate our case to an amazing and rewarding completion. From the beginning of our case, AttorneyAlex Perez and his team  made us feel that our case and getting the desired results were the absolute priority of the firm. They promptly addressed our concerns,  which were many; they immediately responded to our incessant “what ifs” and presented appropriate alternatives that would be most beneficial to us and to keep the case on an active trajectory; most importantly, Attorney Alex Perez provided extremely important legal guidance and answers.  It was so refreshing to have an attorney reflecting honesty.  As an example, on a few occasions we asked questions to which Mr. Perez did not have immediate answers but he would  always assure us that he would research and get us the answers.  Sure enough the answers were always provided.  This human element made dealing with Lipcon, Margulies & Winkleman, P.A. so refreshing.  We were not just given advice and answers to keep us quiet or given legal terminology that was hard to understand.  Everything was clear, concise, simple, and straightforward.   Perhaps the most important element of having Attorney Perez and Ms. Cuellar was the open line of communication. My wife and I often wondered out loud, “Does he have time off?”  We were always involved in all decision making and always given the appropriate legal advice before jointly coming to a decision.  This amazing effortless dedication to our case encapsulated our rewarding relationship with Alex Perez and we, my wife and I, without any reservation, would highly recommend Lipcon, Margulies & Winkleman, P.A. especially Attorney Perez and Ms Cuellar for painless, stress free, successful, and rewarding representation.

I want to thank God for giving me the opportunity of finding a criminal lawyer to represent my son who is not only professional but an extraordinary human being. From the beginning of my journey with Mr. Petruzzi and his staff, I felt I was in good hands. They were always attentive in answering my phone calls, emails, meetings and most importantly serving all my sons legal matters since his arrest. We were provided with guidance along the way, which gave us a sense of comfort and positive thinking. Mr. Petruzzi and staff really go out of their way to attend your legal needs, even on days I would arrive without a scheduled appointment. I’m truly grateful for having the opportunity to work with Mr. Petruzzi and achieving an excellent result to my son’s federal criminal case. Mr. Petruzzi assisted my son and family tremendously by reducing his sentence to the utmost minimum in regards to credit card fraud and for that I am truly grateful and beyond happy with his legal services. Thank you to The Law Offices of Paul D. Petruzzi.

Hiring Mr Paul Petruzzi as my attorney to deal with my case was the best decision that I could ever do. He was always awailable and informative through the entire process.

The staff is incredible in directing your particular situation to Mr. Petruzzi. When you get to sit down with Paul, you will immediately feel as though you are speaking to a friend.  By no means will you get the run around or the regular "lawyer talk" he will be upfront with you let you know all possible outcomes and occurrences and let you sit back and make the intelligent decision for yourself.  I have been a client for 6 years and have referred friends and loved ones to him and will continue to do so in the future.

I never thought I could ever land myself into legal trouble, but it happened. I didn't know what to do and I was without legal representation. A friend recommended I call Paul Petruzzi and I'm glad I did. Mr. Petruzzi gave me peace of mind and assured me that all would be taken care of. Mr. Petruzzi got my case dismissed. I highly recommend him to anyone for any legal need.

Iam so thankful that I chose Paul Petruzzii as my lawyer. I can't say that my case would've gotten dismissed if I had chosen another lawyer. My case was dismissed after his excellent private investigator dug up some ground breaking facts on the so called witness/victim so they threw out all his statements and claims. He also had done a deposition/interrogation on the witness/interrogation which had revealed that he was lying straight through his teeth. I highly recommend Paul Petruzzi and his professional team. I am so happy that I can finally move on with my life and leave this in the past.

I had a great experience with this lawyer. He is very knowledgeable and he personally meets with you and explains the defenses he will use to beat the case. I saw him several nights writing motions for my case. He went to court and argued and we did not have to go to trial, the case was thrown out. I  sincerely appreciate the time and dedication that my lawyer, Albert Quirantes  dedicated to my case. I will never forget this experience which turned out good and a very tough time for me.

This criminal defense attorney is nothing but the best. He actually cares about his clients. I had a criminal arrest and was recommended to him by my cousin.

He tenido un gran problema sobre una petición a mi esposo que estuvo ilegal en estados unidos y luego salio por su propia voluntad. Jamas tuvo problemas legales dentro de los Estados, nuestro único problema fue el haber entrado y haberse quedado. Después de consultar con varios abogados, llegue a la oficina del Sr Michael. Sinceramente, es una persona muy honesta, con mucha paciencia y muy profesional. Me explico detalladamente lo que se necesita hacer, que se podia esperar y como prepararnos. Estoy muy contenta porque a pesar que se pago por el servicio, siento que en realidad se preocupo por nuestra situacion. Mi esposo esta con nosotros ya legalmente en estados unidos. Gracias Michael por todo tu trabajo en nuestro caso. Siempre estaré agradecida y sobre todo por su honestidad.

I am a landlord who is new to the property management world and it was just my luck that my first tenants were the kind of bad tenants who didn't take care of the place or pay the rent. This law office was very patient with me as I made many phone calls throughout the process of the eviction and they even got these tenants to pay me some of what they old even after they were evicted. I highly recommend this law firm to anyone that has to deal with bad tenants.

I am so happy I found Mr. Tockman on the internet and came to them first. Yoli answered all my questions and  put me at ease. I'm so happy I saved my sanity and went to them instead of trying to go through the eviction alone. After going to Mr. Tockman's office, funds were in my account the next day after being 11 days overdue.

Mr. Tockman and his staff were spot on, perfect, personable, professional.

I couldn't  have asked for a better service and recommend this firm highly.

I have had the pleasure of working with this law firm for almost a year and every time I do so it's always a wonderful experience. Even though, I only talk to Yoly, I am confident that everyone in the office is just as knowledgeable and friendly.Yoly always answers the phone and always knows the answer to everything, she is wonderful. She makes evictions quick and easy! Definitely would recommend!

I googled eviction lawyers to get rid of my previous tenants who stopped paying rent and "Stuart L Tockman Law Offices" was one of the options that came up. Being my first time dealing with an eviction process, I took a chance..I walked in to the office and a REALLY nice lady name Yoly greeted me. I explained my situation to her. Not only did she explained to me what services they offer but how the eviction process and the laws which ties to it works (in great detail). She showed me cases as examples, we laid out multiple different options so that I can go with the most effective and cheapest approach, they even suggested to wait a week before paying them to send a 2nd notice and see if my tenants will leave willingly (and they did).They are honest, straight fw, and helpful. That simple. AND they will save you a lot more versus evicting your tenants yourself (I tried that first). My tenants left now, and Yoly is still giving me advice on how to handle new ones. I don't think I'll ever go to anyone else.

Jason, through his network and knowledge of the Elder Law space, connected us with a trust that was able to resolve our issues and turn a difficult situation into a positive outcome.Jason really saved the day and thanks to his assistance my mother is thriving and doing extremely well today.  We have to give him a big thank you for making a tough situation turn out well.

Jason Neufeld is a knowledgeable elder law practitioner whose demeanor is as personable and affable as his vast understanding of the law. It was clear from my first conversation with Jason that he is a lawyer who really cares about his clients; an attorney who's not chasing a buck, but who is pursuit of a justiciable outcome for his clients.I've dealt with many attorneys in the past, but few can hold a candle to Jason in terms of legal competence and as a person to whom a client is more than just a name on a legal file - but rather a human being worthy of respect and compassion.I highly recommend Jason for anyone in need of a great elder law attorney. His kindness and legal acuity are an unbeatable combination.

This guy, Jason Neufeld is great! I have confidence he has my best interests at heart, and also that he knows his field.  I found him warm and caring and easy to reach by, phone or email. And on top of that, his rates were far better than those of the other attorneys I called.

Thank you very much for your legal services and guidance through my bankruptcy proceedings. You and your staff turned an extremely difficult situation into one which was both understandable and manageable. Your manner and courtesy made it easy to discuss very personal matters and your assistance in keeping me organized and on-track was invaluable. Your advice proved to be correct and allowed me to go through the process with dignity and to finally put this nigthmare behind me. I commend you enough for how you helped me during this very stressful time.

Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your professionalism in all aspects of handling my case. I was treated with respect and dignity and really appreciate you and your staff.

Your expert advice and application of the Law allowed us to complete the bankcruptcy with a minimum of delay and maximum efficiency. I would be more than happy to be listed as a reference to your firm and will gladly advise anyone with needs of your services to seek you as counsel. Thank you.

Filing for bankruptcy has always been considered taboo, like having to wear a scarlet letter and live in shame for 7 years. However, I saw no other option, and I was willing to wear the scarlet letter because I preferred to live with some peace of mind as opposed to having to work two or three jobs just to my credit card interest rates. I was referred to Andrew Bellinson by a friend. I walked into his office with anxienty, short of breath, worried, and I walked out of there with a smile, with hope, like a huge weight had been lifted off me. Andrew was very understanding, down to earth and helped me explain everything in a simple manner. He did not complicate things any further. The promtness of the whole process left me in awe, from the moment we filed until my case was heard by the Court, it went by so quick that I couldn't believe it.  I thank adrew and his staff for helping me out in such dark moment in my life and for shedding some light on my situation. I highly recommend him for any bankcruptcy matter you may be considering

When a family needs help, (Legal help), it's always difficult to   know who to choose or trust, especially when one is totally out of   the legal loop. One's greatest fear is spending monies that they   don't have and then still having to contend with the same   problems because of poor counseling and legal intervention.  We have heard horror stories from some about their experiences   in unfamiliar legal arenas and have shuddered with fear on their   behalf. Legal services that chrage when they are suppose to be   free, or agencies that put on a legal bandage for you and then   you, the client, end up getting sued.  My wife, Joanna and J. Michael Arias, would like to Thank Andrew   Bellinson and Hiss Office of Partners for their Excellence on our   behalf. Although a bit anxious about case, no sleep was lost.  We were represented expeditiously and correctly, embracing a   higher caliber of legal standar and etiquette than are usually seen   these days, with compassion an care for the client.  I found comfort when my Son and Daughter recommended   Attorney Andrew Bellinson, and although a bit apprehensive, I   found Mr. Bellinson and his Associates to be an awesome group.   they not only approached our legal matter with great expertise   and enthusiasm but made extra efforts to contact us informed of   each situation, action, and appointment. Their work is like a finely   tuned clock. We were contacted before every appoinment and   before each meeting. We were assisted in understanding and   fulfilling our responsibilities. What a team! The Bellinson group   helped restore our confidence in the legal field. We highly   recommend the Bellinson team to anyone in need of legal   counseling or assistance.  Thank you very much Andrew Bellinson Law Group.

The team at Malloy & Malloy have been amazing with all my Trademark and Patent needs. John Malloy and his colleagues are very highly skilled and easy to communicate with, which makes working with them a very positive experience.

I also feel there's a nice personal touch that they have not found elsewhere in similar firms.

Todd M. I had a case dealing with work injury and my attorney is Bobby Wells a very great person to work with and got the job done in no time. Jose is awesome at getting the proper information and listenting to help you out in any way that he can. Jose is excellent. Not once did he ever cut me off, tried to over talk me,  or just rush me off the phone he always took the time to listen to my concerns and he did it the best way possible to help me. I wish it was more employees like Jose. Between Mr Wells and Jose excellent work I give them 5 stars.

Having never used a service like this before I didn't know what to expect, but everything was made very clear and I'd certainly recommend their services. I was surprised how easy going the gentlemen was that I spoke with. I believe he said he was the owner. I went into this thinking that I would be taken advantage of because I am a girl that doesn't know anything about this. I was explained what I could do and to my surprise it was affordable. I called my girlfriends that were curious to know about their husbands & boyfriends as well. This company helped all of them and even gave them a discount because they were referred by me. I wont date anyone again without calling this company first and making sure it's safe.

My wife and I have used another agency's Investigation services in Dade County and to be fair, they weren't that bad. It was suggested to us to call Nathans Investigations for a more personal approach to an issue we found ourselves in. The owner Eric is by far the most honest and accurate we've used so far. He is a pleasure to talk to and gives great advice as to any and all options we had. Eric knows his stuff, he's a well rounded professional and we were very pleased with our results. Since I cannot go into detail about our specific needs, I can say Eric is prompt in his response time and quotes a fair price for his services,  I'll even go beyond that and say it's more than fair in many cases.

Michael Haber represented me in a felony case, was able to get me into a pre trial diversion program just as he explained.

His fees are also very reasonable!Thank you for not only making today a very special day for me and my family but having always made us a priority even when we were not aware of it!!!

Best Attorney Money Can Buy.  This guy saved me from a total psychological breakdown. I was a total wreck as a result of my divorce, and Mr. Cabral eased   the process for me by providing outstanding representation. My wife had to pay me alimony and child support after abandoning the Kids and I. I thought I was done, having foregone my career opportunities for years in order to play the role of stay home dad so that  my ungrateful wife could pursue her own career. I got everything the law afforded a person in my situation. I WOULD DEFINITELY HIRE. MR. CABRAL AGAIN!!!

I have been taking my kids here for years, and have always been a happy customer. This movie theater is usually clean, the staff is helpful, and the seats and quality of the movie are excellent. The price is reasonable, though these prices keep on rising and my wallet doesn't like it!

Great Movie Theater!Very well kept movie theater. Multiple showtimes to fit your schedule and to reduce sell outs. They have plenty of food to eat once in the theater. The seating is comfortable and has multiple levels to make sure the person in front is not in your way. It has Imax/3D/etc. The only flaw is that it is pricey, but that is a common theme of movie theaters. You are paying for the experience.You can get a good deal by eating at Johny Rockets first, it is directly across the theater.

Firstly, Cobb Theaters in Miami Lakes seems to be runned by unefficient empolyees. The floors are poorly swept, there  is no security inside the theater, and that allows kids to run up and down the theater. Also, the bathrooms hardly ever have any soap and and most of the door handles don't work. CLEAN UP !

hello my name is Merida Perez, and I am 80 years old. Are you to heritage my grand daughter's Yorkshier Terrier  Betty years ago when she went off to do her PhD and my daughter, her mother, KB to move in with me to help me with the activities of daily living. Maddox means the world to me and he is a therapy dog for myself . I have been going to Bubbles for many years I do the odor in the staff very well they have gone above and beyond their job duties if picking me up and dropping me off to my home since we live very close by there place is very clean  pet friendly, it smells like I wish my house smelt,  of the staff and older's eyes light up immediately  do you feel like you're rude you're rude home and feel confident in their care of your family member, your pet. The owner is excellent the cuts are meticulous and she really was born for the  task she has at hand.  She is a wonderful caring person humidity are you up to "pet-tarian", and our family would never change her for the world and we go the distance if we had to.  Very humble down to earth God like Sarid focused and confident in what she's doing. Don't miss the experience !! --Merida Perez for "Maddox Chiclet Cespedes"

I have gone all over Miami looking for a groomer that does a good job and is reasonably priced.. I finally found my place at Bubbles!! We have a miniature schnauzer their cut is not easy and when not done well you can tell- the groomer at bubbles does a great job!! The most important thing though is that they clearly treat their clients well, my pup has never come home with any cuts and he is always done in a reasonable amount of time! This is our groomer of choice and we highly recommend it!!

Dog's Best Friend is the best grooming  shop I have ever been to. They have been there for over 30 years and their experiance really shows. They groom my dog's perfectly every time. I love how they clean their teeth without putting them to sleep,and so much less then the Vet.They are friendly  and the wait time is always so short even less then an hour if I need it.They always let me know if my dogs have any health problems and often times they recommend natural cures without me having to go to the Dr.I love this place and anyone reading this will agree when they go there.

Gypsy-Doodle-The-Wonder-Poodle is a digger and I am THE WORST at dog grooming and bathing.  I am a single guy taking care of my daughter's mini poodle and she gets really dirty and curly fast. Dredlocks!!!  I also a procrastinator, so when I take Gypsy she really NEEDS grooming or that bath. Michelle is the best.  Not only is she a fabulous groomer - but a truly unique person who cares about her customers….. both the dogs and humans who are owned by them. Michelle doesn't yell at me and it is like getting a brand new dog every time. Her work is exceptional, her advice is based on years of experience and caring, and her love for her work is genuine.  Gypsy would be lost without her and truly looks forward to bathing and grooming days with Michelle and her staff.  And if you are lucky like me - Michelle will even call you to remind you to bring in your dog. None better!

This is the best Dog Grooming shop I have ever been to. It is so clean and the owner Michelle has been there for 30 years,she is so experienced.

I was so happy I found This place they are wonderful and my dog Chief looks so perfect everytime. I love how they do him so fast and I do not have to leave him all day. You should call them

I went to dog's best friend  today for the first time.  I have a springer spaniel who is 7 years old.  She is the most important member of my family.  I was  so imptressed with Michelle's professionalism and her loving attitude towards my baby, Cassie.  Not only did she look  beautiful, but her teeth were cleaned for the first time without sedation,which has saved me hundreds of dollars from the vet.  Cassie and I have now become lifelong customers of dogs best friend and there is nobody in the profession that could  compare to Michelle's skills and customer service.

I have been going to Dog's Best Friend for many years.This is my third dog and like all the others they are like my children.Michelle the owner for 28 years is so experienced and always makes me and my dogs feel so comfortable. They always look fabulous. Be cause she knows so much about dogs she always advices me and saves me lots of money from going to the Vet. She cleans their teeth and does not have to put them to sleep, this alone saves me hundreds of dollars. I wouldn't use any other groomer.

Wooooah just about time to find a Pet grooming with such great service as this one, I am really happy to have found it and recommend it to anyone, if I could give it 10 stars I would do so. The girls are wonderful and their work is top notch.

I am so happy with how they treat my dogs, they are down to earth and they always go an extra mile to keep customers and pets happy, there is no place in Miami that gives such quality versus price. Best place I have found so far. Btw the only thing I have to say is that they need to put a couple more signs because they are a bit hidden thank god they set up two really tall flags otherwise I don't think I would have found it. All in all it is well worth the trouble, this girls are great.

They are great, I am so happy to have found this place to leave Pepper, I had to leave town for the week and they looked after him and took care of all his needs.

Thank you to everyone at Pet Place for making my doggy smell and look great for the holidays!!!!!!!!!!! Considering I gave them short notice.  I called in a panic and they were willing to groom my doggy, including teeth cleaning, last minute so I could take my doggy with me to a holiday Party!!!! And the price was right ;)

BEST PLACE FOR YOUR PET. I am back in the area after over a year. I came back to Pet Place because while away, I tried a few places and none of them could compare to Pet Place. I was happy to find out they are as good as I remember  or even better.  The owner was as happy to see my Sunshine as she was to see him. This is a place that cares for your dog and their lever of service is above any place I tried. If you are in the area, you should give it a try, you wont go anyway else after.

It's the best pet resort in Miami. My pets love the place so much that as soon as we get into the car, they know where we are going and get excited! They love it so much, that as soon as they see the owners and staff, they get super happy and wag their tails like crazy. They never want to leave the place! I think everyone should go to this pet resort. It's that amazing!

Very very impressed. I only heard about Grooming Loft through the home town magazine. Thought I would give it a try. The deal seemed too good to turn down.Got an appointment which suited me, my babies were treated with utmost care, and the quality of the cut was better than I had experienced in other local groomers. I will certainly e recommending to my friends. And thanks Mayra for staying a bit longer when I was caught in traffic.

I moved to Miami Beach 6 months ago and was initially concerned about using grooming loft due to the negative comment on grooming on the beach. However,my neighbhor swore by them so I gave them the benefit of doubt. I have now used Grooming Loft 3 times for a haircut on my poodle (Sylvie).  I am very impressed with the standard of grooming, the prices and the customer service. The place is clean, staff friendly and the accessories, food and toiletries are always stocked well.I strongly recommend this salon.

We (Stella & Gordon) are pleased to announce that on 1st May 2012 we purchased the Grooming Loft business from its previous owner (Michelle).We are very excited about taking over this business and are very thankful to Michelle for building and retaining a loyal and knowledgeable clientele.As with any new business owner, we have spent our time getting to know clients, as they bring their dogs for grooming, meeting suppliers and analysing the reviews of Grooming Loft on the internet review sites. As with all businesses there are the Good, the Bad and the down right Ugly.The good, as has always been the case with Grooming Loft, has been the quality of grooming, the prices and care taken by the staff. Thus, it is only right that we re-assure clients that the grooming and support staff and the prices will remain. Where there are areas for improvement in these areas they will be addressed accordingly.The bad, has referred to the length of time it has taken to return a pet and the odour of the reception area. Having spoken to many clients, there does seem to be a preference for dropping off their pet in the morning and to collect after work and this service will remain. That said, we do need to consider clients, that require a quick turn round, i.e. shortening the time from bringing their pets to collecting them. With this is mind we will offer a timed appointment service, for those clients that require it. This will be similar to a Vet, Doctor, Hair Salon, where a dog will have an appointment and should be brought in as close to that time as possible and there will be an agreed return time.As for the odour in the reception area, it was obvious from our first two weeks, that a significant number of clients' pets relieve themselves in this area.Though this is cleaned up, over the day it does become clear that a certain odour  exists. With this in mind, we will be introducing eco and pet friendly cleaning products to ensure we remove this odour. We will also ask our clients to walk their dogs before entry into Grooming Loft.Thankfully, we have not come across anything downright Ugly. We expect our staff to treat you and your pets with courtesy, consideration, and without discrimination. Please treat our staff in the same way.

My beagle never liked getting his nails clipped. Somehow they found a way to do it and he became very used to it. Now its no big deal for him. I was completely amazed because he doesnt like anybody touching his paws. My kids love when he comes home from the groomers because i give them the OK to play with him because he smells great! and hes sparkling clean.

I had a problem with leaving my dog with groomers because I dont know, it is hard to trust someone with your pet. Tender Pet Grooming by Yuli did a great job, not only my dod came out looking great, he looked really happy to be there and he even kissed the groomer before we left. Very nice experienced.

Pretty Pups is the absolute best. So thankful for everything they do for our Yorkies. It’s always a pleasure seeing the Pretty Pups truck pulling up to our home. There are very nice, the service is great and the dogs are bathed on a weekly basis. It can’t get better than that😉

Just moved to Miami from Orlando and was referred by someone I met at a dog park in midtown. My pooch is huge and very hairy. He was way due his groom and quite honestly a mess : ). The staff at this place where professional and friendly to both me and Arnold (his name). They explained the process and about how much time they estimated they would need (4 hours minimum). To my surprise they called me exactly 3 hours and 45 minutes after I left and told me Arnold was ready for pick-up. Ahhh...he was like a new dog and smelled clean and fresh...looked even better. I was very pleased and think we have found our new place for grooming here in Miami. (Thanks to Lola's mom from the dog park).

I love to bring my cat for boarding and grooming to this amazing place that is the only place in Miami that cater exclusively to cats. In the past I used to ask my neighbors to take care of my cats not anymore. I can travel with confidence knowing my babies are in the best hands. I also love to bring them for pampering in a stress free environment without barking dogs! I highly recommend everyone to check out this great place.

My cat loves to visit this cat hotel. He is taken care 24/7 and the fact that cater just to felines make him and me happy. I've been boarding my cat multiple times for the last few years. My cat is a persian to I also bring him to get pampered in between boarding visits to get groomed.  He always is happy, content and for me it is peace of mind and that doesn't have a price. I highly recommend it.

"We had the experience that everybody should have.You know you want to purchase your dream house, and you should receive a full service to make you enjoy every second of the processFrom the beginning to the end of the process, Richard blew us away.From the first showing, the exploration phase to the closing, Richard listened to us, and found us what we were looking for.I would recommend anyone to use his services, if they want to purchase a property in Miami.He was not condescendent because our budget was not a million dollars or more.He took us as we were and found us our little piece of paradise.We trusted him, and we were 100% right.He always kept in touch to see everything was good, and I would say that it is very comforting.2 thumbs up for Richard and Paz Global Real Estate."

I was recommended by a good friend to Paz Global Investments. I met Richard Paz who is the broker. He was very knowledgable and he did a great job in selling my condo. Previously I had my condo for a few months with another realtor , we were told that the market was slow and that we needed to lower the price. When I dealt with Richard Paz. It was a completly different approach. I was very impressed with his profesionalism. After 2 weeks the condo was sold at above market value. It was a easy, smooth transaction, Mr. Paz even came to the closing with us. It was a great experience from start to finish. I will recoment Paz Global to all my friends and family.

Malik is an extremely reliable, understanding, and a patient professional. He helped me in the sale of a Brickell area condo. It took 2 months for me to move forward with a commitment, as I was contemplating different areas to live. Long-suffering he is! I was unsure and nervous with my 1st purchase, but it all worked out. Best agent on the street hands down. Quality service, patience, perseverance! 10 thumbs up!

Malik! My wife and I are amazed at how you brought us to the finish line on our new home! The entire process was efficient, fast, and surprisingly 'low-stress'. We attribute that to your experience and, most of all, respect for our expectations and life situations. Thank you again, and we look forward to the champagne toast on our deck!

I've worked with Mr. Padgett, for 15 years.  I am currently working with Mr. Padgett on housing for relocation to Miami, FL., as my daughter will be attending college there in 2017. He is the only realtor I call for info, resources and location recommendations.
 -

 - 
Dynamic and skilled, and most importantly, Malik keeps his word. I would recommend him for his superb professionalism and creative ideas. I just relocated to Miami and need to get settled in a rental until we I am able to purchase a home, which of course, I will be using him again. His attention to  detail was most appreciated, because any one knows that relocation from another state can be stressful and challenging. But of course, he made the process smooth with effortless streamlined procedures that I could not be more grateful for. Any one looking to relocate with ease, he is your guy. 2017 is approaching and knowing that I have an agent in place for the next steps when I am ready to purchase,, is assuring.

Malik was helpful, knowledgeable, and understanding of our timing and budget. We were glad to have found him. He is extremely patient and recommended lenders that were willing to work with us. The home owner experience can be taxing and time consuming. I personally recommend educating ones self of  neighborhoods, home values, etc. We realize we need more timing. but when we are ready, Malik will be the one that we use.

Jorge from High End Luxury is my hero!! I came to him on the verge of giving up--hunting for the perfect condo in Miami was so overwhelming! Jorge made everything simple; he set up the appointments, arranged the walk-thrus, and went out of his way to make sure I found the perfect place. And I did! Actually, it was in the first building he showed me...further proving that he listened to what I was looking for. He also did a great job explaining everything to my husband who was not a fan of the luxury buildings at first...he loves it now! I would recommend Jorge to anyone and can't wait to do business with him in the future. He's truly amazing at what he does!Thank you Jorge; you're the best!!

Hands down this is the best law firm that I've used. Ms. Mathis and Mr. Carpenter was very helpful throughout the entire case. I mainly was assisted by Ms. Mathis and she was great. Any time I had a question or concern she gave me a clear explanation. Response times were phenomenal. I've never had to sit and wonder if they received my email message or phone call. I'm  still amazed at the service and outcome of my case. I know 5 stars are the max that you can rate  a company but they truly deserve 10+ stars. Thank you again for providing excellent service. I will definitely refer any of my friends/family that's in need of legal assistance to your firm. Continue the great work and I hope you all continue to thrive.

First I would like to say that I am completely at fault for falling so far in my back-taxes. I was w-2 then 11 years ago switched to 1099. Needless to say, I couldnt afford my taxes due. I waited and waited but was never able to catch up. One day I was hit with a bank levy and wage garnishment. I called Anderson Bradshaw Conusltants because enough was enough. They stopped the garnishment within two days. It took longer(of course) to completely fix my tax mess, but they did. Completely honest and worth it. definite recommend!!

I am a truck driver and have been for 25 years. For the past 10 years I went without filing my taxes. I have back taxes, a levy, A bank Levy, And my wages were about to be garnished. I called Anderson Bradshaw consultants and within seven hours they stopped my bank levy. And released my wage garnishment. I am on the road to being settled with the IRS and state taxes. Also, I can go back to work without any worry.

I didn't get what I thought I would get when I paid for my daughter's tax case to be handled by this group. She ended up paying as much as she would if we had just done it ourselves. I should have just kept the $3000 I spent with them. Didn't meet expectations they set up front. Not a good experience.

I was a bit nervous at first trusting a company I found online to help me with taxes, but John immediately put me at ease. I owed over $75,000 to the IRS and had a number of missing tax returns and the IRS had already put a wage garnishment on my pay and had just hit my bank account for a sizable chunk of change. Within 24 hours of signing up John put me in touch with an ABC Attorney who got me my money back from the IRS and stopped the wage garnishment. I was kept informed throughout the process and every step was explained to me to make sure I knew what was happening. At the end, I only ended up having to pay the IRS $2,500. I cannot recommend Anderson Bradshaw enough.

I had not filed for 13 years!!!!! I decided to get married so I had to file but didn't have any w-2's or payroll tax information or deductions. Anderson Bradshaw took care of all of that for me. Now I am all caught up on my taxes and it feels great. I didn't even have to do a thing.

I came to Anderson Bradshaw with a $36,000 tax liability. After speaking with Mr. King, he put me in good hands with Josh Kronick. He immediately protected me from IRS Collection action, informed me every step of the way for what to expect from the process, and ultimately delivered me an Offer-in-Compromise that settled my tax burden for $500. I cannot recommend this firm enough. They gave me a fresh lease on life. Thank you!

When we received a letter from the IRS saying my daughter owed them over $18,000 for income in 2013, we nearly had heart attacks! Her U.S. income in that year was only around $5,000, because that was the year she started teaching in Asia. Calls to the IRS gleaned only a little information, but it appeared that an ex of hers had accessed her PayPal account, sold his products online, but not forwarded the information to her nor did he tell her about it. I found Anderson Bradshaw online, contacted them, and after working with Josh and Ted for a short period, they managed to get it all cleared up and proper paperwork filed to clear her of all liabilities. We could not have done it without their help, and I will be eternally appreciative.

I am a United States Navy Veteran, who recently found himself in hot water with IRS . They wanted all these old returns and W-2' s that I haven't seen in years . I called around for help but the tax preparers could only go back 2 years. The other tax firms wouldn't return my call. It was only when I contacted Anderson Bradshaw and spoke to Ted England that I was finally able to get the help that I needed. I am not some rich guy or some huge company ; however, Ted was willing to take the time to get my issue resolved. Thanks to Anderson Bradshaw Tax Consultants I am finally able to get my life back from the IRS.

I was paying the IRS $400 a month for 2 years and I was getting NO WHERE!  When I initially set it up I didn't realize how much they charged for penalties and interest.  It's down right criminal (but that's whole different story) Last summer, things got pretty tough for my wife and I, we were robbing Peter to pay Paul and we just couldn't keep up with the payment any longer.  I had spoke with a few companies a couple years back when all of this started, but they didn't seem like they could offer too much help.  Thankfully I found Anderson Bradshaw through YP and I'm really happy that I did!  I spoke with Ted, he was very patient and answered all of my questions through out the consultation. He explained our options and mapped out a step by step outline of how they were going to resolve our case. There's finally a light at the end of the tunnel for us and they saved us quite a bit of money in the end.  Thank so much for ending this nightmare & getting us that Fresh Start you promised

I CALLED ANDERSON BRADSHAW TAX CONSULTANTS. EXPECTING MR.BRADSHAW, GOT TED ENGLAND .HE SEEMED PROFESSIONAL AND KNOWLEDGEABLE,SMART. CAN ANYONE HONESTLY TELL ME WHAT TO EXPECT FROM HIM.IS HE FOR REAL OR WANNABE?

When I began my search for a tax attorney, it was my understanding  "serve this area" would have been completed in the state I resided.  My paperwork made it across the country from Los Angeles, California to Baltimore, Maryland.  The same paperwork had to be submitted twice, one for each office.   I would have felt more comfortable if the paperwork could have been handled once.   I know that I would have felt more confident  if I could have worked with the same person the whole way through the process.

I cannot recommend ANDERSON BRADSHAW highly enough. There is always a courteous person to answer my questions and I personally work with Bill Davis most all the time. He has dealt with all my inept questions and queries. My account is not completely settled but is moving right along and the results are definitely are meeting my approval! My husband and I had ourselves in a real mess and they are getting things worked out really well. If you have any doubts about this company...don't hesitate to HIRE THEM ASAP!

I'm happy to write this review. I called ABC Tax two months ago when the IRS put a lien on my home and levied my wages. I was in $85,000 in debt to the IRS from when I started my own business many years ago. I never made any money in that business and now the IRS is threatening to take everything I have. As soon as I was transferred to Jeff, he put my mind at ease.  He is very knowledgable about tax help and tax resolution. He told me that he can stop the levy that day. and that I could settle my tax bill for only 5k. You guys did what you promised and now that I am paying back my reduced amount, The irs is removing the lien on my home and now I have a fresh start.

These guys got the lien removed on my bank account in one day, and set up payments to the IRS that I could afford. Thanks, A-B!

My wife works as independent contractor and we got careless about quarterly deposits so after about 2 years we owed way too much. We looked around and this guy calmed us down and was able to get us some kind of compromise with the IRS  and payments that we can now afford. yes, we recommend them.

A tax preparer whom I have worked with for years turned out to be stealing from me. Michelle Moya Pearl stole my stimulus money, opened fraudulent accounts using my identity, and screwed me on my latest tax return when I began connecting the dots. Absolutely scandalous, this company is well aware of her wrong doings. Don't trust these people with your information or money.

Being legally bound to financial jargons all my life, I faced some tax evasion issues last year where I was going to be rendered superfluous by the court if they had acquitted me. Even though I was right in my own terms, with the help of OMG Tax, they efficiently discovered the fissures in the data I kept. It was truly an astounding experience.

Bryan from Atlantis Plumbing came out to address a water pressure issue and found right away that our water had been almost turned completely off at the meter. I'm guessing that someone may have confused our meter with the neighbor's a few weeks ago and inadvertently turned our water almost off by mistake. Because it wasn't completely off, we had no idea and assumed a water pressure issue. While here, Bryan tightened a leaky outside spigot too. Very courteous and gracious. Insisted we test to be sure all was okay with the pressure in our house. Thanks to him, it was!! Very grateful.

Atlantis Plumbing, Dallas office exceeded all expectations. Jackie and Berry were outstanding individuals that were punctual, professional and informative.

All around fantastic experience.  I have utilized so many different plumbers throughout the years and none of which I would use again;  however, Atlantis will have my business from here on out and will be highly recommended to all my friends, family, and clients.  Prices are very fair. Jackie and Barry did some extensive work for my client (two full days) and their meticulous work, expertise, and pride in doing a job well-done was clearly reflected.  They truly went above and beyond and took care of items that weren't even on the punch-list.  Very friendly and professional. I couldn't be happier.

Wow! I don't usually write reviews, but in this case, I had to. I noticed water coming from under the house and decided to call a professional. Based on their stellar reviews, I called Atlantis. Butch and Jerry were prompt and immediately went to work. There is no crawlspace in my house so they had to probe our drain line with a camera. Butch relayed to me that he didn't see much of a problem and said that it was really no major concern. He also talked with me about my septic. When I asked what my bill was, Butch said it was no charge. I could not believe it. Can't say enough about how refreshing it is to deal with a company that doesn't try to take advantage of their customers. I would and will recommend Atlantis to anyone that might have plumbing issues. Thanks again to Butch and Jerry!

At 11:30 am on Saturday Oct 15 we discovered water bubbling up from the ground in our backyard. We quickly realized the main water line from the street to the house was cracked but where? We turned off the water at the meter and then spent the next 30 minutes calling every plumber in the area to see who could come diagnosis, dig, repair quickly. At 1:15pm Tim Robinson from Atlantis arrived. He looked at the small flood in the yard and then in the basement where the water pipes comes in. That's was all he needed. He dug a 2 foot hole where the main line enters and sure has heck the was the cracked pipe. We had him do some additional work while he was there but in less than 2 hrs it was fixed. We HIGHLY recommend Atlantis and TIM ROBINSON.

We’ve been using Atlantis Plumbing for almost 8 years, since we found them on Kudzu.com when we had a plumbing emergency.  They’ve replaced our sewer line (the emergency!), installed a backwater valve, and done lots of little things for us.  They have always been fast, reliable, and reasonably priced, and nothing that they have done has ever given us problems.  They’re also honest.  Today I called them out to fix what we thought was a pipe leak and Tim came out and realized it was just a hole in an odd place in the dishwasher’s drain line that we hadn’t noticed.  He showed me where to change the line didn’t even charge for the visit.  We’ve recommended Atlantis to all of our friends!

Very pleased with company!  Cody & Tyler (plumber & helper) arrived on time, were detail oriented, knew what they were doing-very professional.  The cost was reasonable and the 10 year warranty is great! It was written on the invoice & explained by Cody.  He seemed to take it seriously which was appreciated.  We had a leak between the water meter at street & the house.  We will call on Atlantis for our future plumbing needs.  Thank you for making a frustrating situation a little less painful!

I called Atlantis Plumbing for a small leak in my basement. Turns out it were way more then just a leak. Tim informed me and showed me the faulty parts and what replacement cost would be. Tim, Kris, and Josh were very professional, and got the job done in a timely manner. I highly recommend Atlantis Plumbing and will be contacting them for future plumbing projects.

I called Atlantis on a recommendation from a neighbor. I had an emergency situation and needed a plumber within 24 hours on a weekend. Tim and two helpers were at my house the next morning. The receptionist, Michelle, was very nice and helpful. Tim called me very promptly and again when he was on his way to my house. On time. Polite. I'm so appreciative!

Tim & Josh came on short notice on a Saturday to look for a mysterious leak. They were extremely methodical & were able to identify the source of issues without spending a lot of money diagnosing. They worked on 2 toilets, the regulator, & the water heater. They were quick and professional. If you see them roll up, you're in good hands.

These guys are great. Called them on the 4th of July and luckily was able to get there last appointment of the day.  I called because a bathroom tub wouldn't drain and sludgy mucky water kept rising, even after using a plunger and liquid drain unstoppers. I found out that I had a problem with a blocked sewer at my home. Bobby and Butch came out and quickly had the line unstopped and showed me on camera where roots had blocked the pipe.  I was so impressed with the whole service , they did a great job and provided honest advice on what I needed to do to permanently fix the issue.  GREAT SERVICE!  Pro Service!  Highly Recommend and appreciated helping me on a holiday.

I just recently had my clay sewer line cleared and video inspected by these guys. Roby was informative and gave me a great overview of what needed to be done. The work of replacing the sewer was slow process but Roby and his helper did a great job of avoiding my mature landscaping.  I highly suggest you consider calling and asking for Roby for a personable and informative plumbing experience.

We chose RS Andrews after a friend referred us recently for a new HVAC system and couldn't be happier.

The installation process went so smooth and the techs were highly professional.  We love our new units and highly recommend RS Andrews!

Everything went well until the plumber lied about telling us about payment for a service we weren't informed was being preformed prior. He then lied and said that maybe we didnt understand him since we speak another language, eventhough I speak proper English and have never lived outside the US. I was very offended and will never use this company again.

Our heater went out overnight (of course!) so I figured I’d give RS Andrews a call to have them come out and fix it. Their technician showed up right on time, quickly assessed the situation, determined what was needed to fix the furnace.  He explained everything to me and was able to get everything working again.  I'm very satisfied with RS Andrews and will definitely call them again in the future.

Highly recommend!!  He came out late on a Sunday to help me. He not only found the problem he investigated further and found the REAL issue. The line from our water meter broke. He could have just fixed the broken connection and been done with it - it was Sunday evening, I'm sure he wanted to go see his family. But he stayed and fully invested and after more digging he discovered there were a bunch of unnessary and future problem connections. He really went above and beyond.  I understand why he is booked solid, he does quality work, and is truely cares about his clients.

We had Zippy Plumbing come out and pump our tank. They started digging and water came up. The company that pumped it before  just pumped the water and not solids! Matt from Zippy Plumber told me everything that had happened. He gave details of what him and the other guy were doing. They had to pump more than they were supposed to and put a new drain on the tank. There were no hidden charges it was what he said it would be. They were very friendly, nice and professional. I cant say enough about this company. He answered the phone and was the nicest person. I want to say thank you. We will use them again and I have text everyone I know with a septic tank your number. Thank you again for being so honest!!!

Jerrod Johnson, the service technician was equally awesome and even made my granddaughter feel ok even learning and calling her by name, REAL CUSTOMER SERVICE! I appreciate Jerrod's and Adam's friendliness and professionalism and would recommend this company to any of my family and friends!

My kitchen sink was clogged for days right before Thanksgiving. Roto Rooter was the one that had immediate availability on the day when I called. Martin Niklov came at the time they told me to.

I was very impressive with the service I received. The technician wore shoe covers in my house to ensure they did not mess up my flooring. They were very professional and was able to accurately and quickly diagnosis my issue. They stayed until the issue was resolved and I had adequate water pressure in my home.

Best service in the entire Atlanta area. Polite, friendly and professional all the way. Despite a heavy schedule in 95 degree July weather, Harding was able to squeeze me in in the afternoon. Courteous and knowledgeable tech arrived at 3pm and had my AC unit up and running in a half hour. Be sure to call these folks first: you won't need to call anyone else. Kudos, Harding!

Once again Harding Plumbing to the rescue.  Frozen split pipe in a horrible, hard to reach location.  Sent Zach - polite, professional and knowledgeable.  Great job and reasonable.  We have also used Harding for HVAC and believe it or not our septic and always performed a great job at a reasonable price.  Thanks Harding Plumbing.Eve and Joe Bidosky

On Monday afternoon at 5:55, our compressor went out. Normally we have to replace the hard-start capacitor once or twice a year (it is 17 years old and eats them like candy). I called around and everybody was closed, but Harding Plumbing Heating and Cooling answered their phone. Even though they closed at 5:00, one of the owners (Jack) stayed until 6:30 to sell me the part. That's dedication!When the new part didn't fix things, it was time for a new compressor. I explored my options with several companies. Because of its age, it didn't make sense to just fix the compressor. I decided to go with a whole new unit, both inside and out. Robert sized everything on Tuesday (along with competing HVAC companies). I did my research and Harding has an A+ BBB rating, and they were hundreds less than the other guys.Wednesday morning I called Robert, told him they had the job, and on Thursday they were installing the hardware. Total time was about 3 1/2 hours. Their technicians were courteous and nice. The techs made sure they didn't mar the hardwood floors. All the old stuff was hauled away. They even offered to sweep the hallway beneath the attic stairs!I have never written an on-line review of a company, but I felt compelled to do so this time because of the exceptional service and price I received from Harding. The parts and labor guarantee was the best I saw. I will do business again with the guys at Harding Plumbing Heating and Cooling without hesitation.

We lost our a/c during the hottest part of summer.  What we thought would be an easy fix turned out be a new system.  The Harding A/C Tech helped us make an affordable decision and they fit us in quickly, knowing we had no a/c with temperatures at almost 100 degrees.  The installation was fast and we were nice and cool when there were heat warnings.  We will use Harding Plumbing, Heating and Cooling from now on!!!  The employess, everyone we dealt with, were GREAT!!!!!!!!!

I had Mike fix a leak under my kitchen sink. I had mentioned my garbage disposal wasn't working either.  So after he fixed the leak he fixed my garbage disposal as well.  He was honest and very reasonable.  I would highly recommend him!

I live in California, and my mom needed a hot water heater for her home in Stone Mountain, GA. I called about five companies and was getting prices from 1100 to 1400 dollars. I called Michael from dynamike empire, and he said he would come out and give my mom a free estimate. Well my mom got her hot water heater installed, it did not cost us nearly 1400 and not only did we get the factory 6 year warranty, Mike gave us a 1 year warranty through his company as well. My mom is very pleased and will use him for all her plumbing issues and refer him to others. Thank you dynamike empire.

We had a busted pipe spraying under our house. The city water representatives were, as per usual, entirely unhelpful.  After calling 6 plumbing companies, being put on hold, disconnected and told the earliest service time was 4 days later, we called Atlantis.  They had John Massey out to our home within the hour.  He was knowledgeable, professional (willing to army crawl through our scary crawl space with a smile on) and fixed the leak within minutes.  We are incredibly thankful to have had it taken care of and in a timely fashion. Thanks John!

We called another plumber who looked at the job and said no.   Atlantis Plumbing came out within 3 hours to fix the leak going into our home.  He had to dig down to the basement in the July heat.   I appreciated his service and highly recommend them.

I had a pipe leaking sewage into the basement. The service and work was great! Mike and James came to the house, cut through the concrete to find the old galvanized pipe from 1954 was busted. They replaced it, sealed everything up and I've had no problems since! I'll call them again to fix the basement bathroom.

We have used AP for two of our homes and their level of service and pricing is amazing.  It is always difficult to find good service and companies that stand behind their work.  Tim, Kris and Josh service our basement - they filled in an area around a pipe that was leaking from outside and they did an awesome job.

The line from our water meter to our house broke and we called Atlantis Plumbing on a recommendation from a neighbor. Brian came to our house about 90 minutes after we called Atlantis on Saturday morning to give us options. We were put on the schedule for the following Tuesday and Brian made sure we a had temporary water connection. Brian and James showed up early Tuesday morning and they had the pipe replaced by 2PM that afternoon. They were able to replace the entire pipe with minimal digging and no disruption to the sidewalk or any landscaping. Excellent Job.

Just had my Septic Tank flushed out on 2/12/13 and now its backing up again. I called back the place that did it but they wanted to charge me an arm and leg to pump it again.I decided to call around and ask for different price quotes. When I called Affordable Plumbing and Septic the Tech told me that there was something wrong with my Main Sewer Line, because once you pump your Seetic Tank it is supposed to last for at least 5 years. They came out and dug up my tank and found that my Main Sewer Line was the problem and needed to be replaced. After the job was done everything is working just perfect.

I called a plumbing company to come and look at my pipes. the water was not flowing right and some time even debris would come out. The plumbing company told me I had roots in my pipes but their price was too high. I called Affordable Plumbing and Septic and the price they gave me was much more pleasing to my ears. Great Company and Workers. They are my new plumbers.

What can I not say about this company!  They are #1!  Their plumbers are experienced and courteous!  Their prices are reasonable!  The owner is personable and knows his stuff!  I have never dissatisfied!  If you want A-1 plumbing services, choose Ashmel's Plumbing Company!!!

ASHMEL'S Plumbing was a God send for me. My phone call to them was not only handled professionally but you could actually hear the consideration and concern in the voice of the person that took my call. The technician that came was professional, courteous and knowledgeable. He resolved my plumbing problem in a timely manner. The cost was very reasonable. My over all experience with this company was wonderful. I highly recommend ASHMEL'S to anyone with a plumbing problem. Thank you, ASHMEL'S.

We had sewage backing up in our yard and 125 ft worth of sewer piping had to be replaced.  Ashmel's completed the job in one day.  The plumbers only took water breaks and worked continuously until the job was done.  After getting estimates from other plumbers, I definately got the job done cheaper with Ashmels.  I would definatelly recommend Ashmel's Plumbing  to anyone who needed a plumber they could trust.

These guys are top notch!  I've needed to use them on several occasions for Water Heater issues and broken A/C and Heater problems,   They also have done some plumbing work for me.  If you want honest, reliable, and affordable home maintenance service, look no further.  You will not be nickle and dimed and can rest assured you get work done right and at a fair price.

It is so hard to find good people to help you, especially when you are a single women. My furnace quit working so I contacted several people to help diagnose the issue. I had three different quotes  and the first two did not feel honest. They were also very over priced and both recommended replacing the unit. Complete House Maintenance were so helpful, on time, honest, and had great pricing and were able to diagnose the issue to help prevent the replacement of the unit. The fix was under $125. I really appreciate all they had too offer and the work they did. I would highly recommend them and I will use them again in the future!

We finally found an affordable HVAC company in Atlanta. We received a few other estimates to repair our unit and this company blew away the competition. They showed up on time, were super courteous, showed me exactly what was wrong and completed the repairs with no surprises. Most importantly, they were honest and showed me that they only had to change the capacitor, saving me from replacing the entire unit! 5 Stars!

Great Service & Low Cost. Complete House Maintenance are reliable, high quality and low cost. They repair things right the first time. Their charges are much lower than others in Atlanta metro, but do a great job. They do not push expensive replacement. I had an emergency with a gushing, broken water heater, so they came right away and fixed it. They are honest, good people. I highly recommend them.

I am very fond of my plumbers. How many of you can say that? Really. They are knowledgeable, communicate well, and are expert old house problem-solvers. If their hourly rate scares you, I would suggest that M Cary can probably do in an hour what someone else might dawdle over for much longer. They are generous with free advice and have coached me through several minor repairs rather than charging me for their time.

We've had the need to use a plumber twice this year - once to replace a section of pipe leaking in our basement and the other to replace the gas connection from the meter into the house.  Hiring any contractor to do a job isn't cheap but you do expect good work, honesty and friendly service.  M Cary & Daughters Plumbing delivered on all three accounts and we were very satisfied with the work they did.  On the gas line replacement, we contacted them to get a 2nd opinion and not only did they come up with a less disruptive/invasive solution, it was less expensive than the quote from the first plumber.  M Cary & Daughters is on our list of reliable plumbing contractors!

For 10+ years I've had plumbers attempting to fix the bathroom in my basement. It's been a great waste of time and money until Mike and James of Atlantis Plumbing came by. They did their research before offering a fantastic, cost effective solution that actually works! This is the second time I've called them for help with plumbing in my home. I am thrilled with the service and work they did and would highly recommend them to anyone.

EGS and contractors  are amazing.Our hot water heater died on us. It's a Polaris 30 gallon high efficiency boiler that is not very common.Egs arrived very promptly and got right to work. He diagnosed the issue in about 5 minutes as a faulty ignitor. Then the hard part came, finding a replacement part. the contractor called everyone he knew and the nearest part was nearly an hour north or south of AtlantaMy contracor remembered seeing a very similar part at a supplier down in SODO. He took the chance and drove down to the shop. He arrived back at my house 20 minutes later with the part. It required a very minor modification to the wiring harness. About 30 minutes later it was installed and tested.We now have hot water once again!these guys is a rare people. They are knowledgeable and creative with problem solving.

The first time we called EGS Plumbing, they cleared a drain for us and pumped water from our crawl on very short notice following a storm.  They were very quick to respond and were very courteous and professional.  EGS also installed a Toto toilet for us, and moved a toilet shutoff valve.  The job was very clean and their experience showed.  I would use them again and would recommend them to friends

We needed a plumber to clear the drain for our washer hook up, hook up a slop sink and install new supply lines at our kitchen sink.  I emailed a quote request and EGS PLUMBING was out the same day to look at the work and give me a qoute.  He completed the work the very next morning and did an outstanding job.  Courteous, professional and clean.  It was nice to work with an owner/operator. I highly recommend EGS Plumbing to anyone in need of plumbing services in the West Seattle area.

Had spent $650 trying to get basement toilet to flush.  Plumber had been here twice and finally admitted defeat.  I called Fulton that morning and T.J. was here at noon.  He ran camera through the line and found the problem.  He discovered a part needing to be removed.  He copied down the manufacturer and said he would take care of trying to find replacement part.  He was very careful and didn't mind me hanging around asking questions.  I appreciate the prompt professional service I have routinely received from Fulton.

We've used Plumb Works for all of our plumbing needs for several years, and have worked with several of their technicians, all of whom received five stars.  Leslie Dunsmore, the most recent who replaced and re-plumbed a water heater and a laundry room faucet set, continues their 5-star tradition:  Knowledgeable, professional, reliable, friendly (especially to our 5-year old grand daughter, Lyra), and patient with all of our questions about each step of the projects.  We will call Plumb Works and likely ask for Leslie to next time we need help.

These guys are great. Called them on the 4th of July and luckily was able to get there last appointment of the day.  I called because a bathroom tub wouldn't drain and sludgy mucky water kept rising, even after using a plunger and liquid drain unstoppers. I found out that I had a problem with a blocked sewer at my home. Bobby and Butch came out and quickly had the line unstopped and showed me on camera where roots had blocked the pipe.  I was so impressed with the whole service , they did a great job and provided honest advice on what I needed to do to permanently fix the issue.  GREAT SERVICE!  Pro Service!  Highly Recommend and appreciated helping me on a holiday.

I just recently had my clay sewer line cleared and video inspected by these guys. Roby was informative and gave me a great overview of what needed to be done. The work of replacing the sewer was slow process but Roby and his helper did a great job of avoiding my mature landscaping.  I highly suggest you consider calling and asking for Roby for a personable and informative plumbing experience.

these guys are good, and their prices were lower than others in town.  i got three quotes for replacing my sewer main and these guys were the best.  they didn't even charge me to run the camera down the line.  then after the job was done they fixed the leaking water main valve for me, for parts only!  They are really on the ball and wants to do a great job at a fair price.

Bryan Baer handled my case personally and was awesome!! I read a lot of reviews n have personal acquaintances that say it takes years to get ur money. But not with these guys!! He got the insurance co to write a check ASAP for car damages and then just a few short months received another for personal injury! The guy that hit me had the minimal pay out so getting money from something that isnt there is like pulling teeth BUT this guy knows what he's doing and would have gone after the guy personally had he not been a 24yr old living with parents n no assets!! So he found other alternatives to get me even more AND got my Grady bill lowered from $36,000 to $18,000 for a maximum pay out that I didn't expect at all!!! AND ALL of this was done in a matter of MONTHS NOT YEARS!!! THIS GUY IS AWESOME!!

In April 2015, I was rear ended by a drunk driver at the red light. I had serious head, neck and back injuries I was taken by ambulance to the hospital. Once I  was discharged from the hospital I went online  to search for a car accident attorney.  I clicked on AVVO website, which had all the ratings for the top Attorneys in Atlanta, I came accross Tony's profile and after readinga few of his cases I contact his office. Tony set up a meeting with me the same day and after meeting and talking with him I knew he was the right attorney for me. He is very proffessional and friendly which made it very easy to talk to him. Tony was able to settle my case in a timely manner and I received a nice settlement!

I have been working with the Kalka & Baer LLC Law Group for a few months now and they have been nothing but professional, knowledgeable, and attentive. I was involved in a motorcycle accident and it wasn't easy for me to be mobile. Tony Kalka personally visited my home and explained to me in full the process of my situation. My paralegal has been extremely informative about the entire process, they followed up with me on a regular basis, and replied to my emails within minutes (which I greatly appreciate!). Without Tony and Matthew, I’m not sure what I would have done. I highly recommend this firm to anyone looking for quality service. David Parker

I was involved in a car accident and referred to Kalka & Baer.  Tony, Alfred and the entire office staff are true professionals focused on client satisfaction.   They are extremely knowledgeable and work with confidence throughout the process.  I have a very busy schedule and they handled everything while keeping me informed.  I have a great amount of confidence recommending Kalka & Baer to provide excellent service and great results!

My experience working with Tony Kalka and Alfred Evans at Kalka & Baer LLC, has truly been a blessing.  The process was seamless. When I initially had the accident I didn’t think I would need an attorney. As the pain continued to progress to the point where I needed numerous procedures, I went to AVVO.com to make sure I selected the right firm. Skeptical about dealing with attorneys from past experiences, I met with several attorneys before actually selecting one. Since the day I signed the retainer with Tony and Alfred I had not one concern with the advice or service. They make a remarkable team.  They were always available, very knowledgeable, and professional. They made sure they were very thorough and explained every little detail. They were very personable and empathetic, which was exhibited throughout the case. When it came down to structuring my settlement, they put me in the perfect position and they were very transparent and diligent, in not just getting the best settlement offer, but also reducing my liability such as medical bills, etc. This firm is very well respected in the industry and because of that they were able to settle my case within the first 30 days of the demand letter.  Before you select any attorney, meet with Tony and Alfred at Kalka & Baer LLC and I am sure you will go with this firm, and understand why they are among the most respected and prestigious lawyers and law firm in the Greater Atlanta Area.      ~ Ron H.

Our family experienced a personal tragedy last winter with the death of a dear family member due to terrible accident. Tony and his team were compassionate and worked with us through the entire process, taking extra care to explain any complications and challenges presented by the case. They were also terrific in working with all sides to get us the best possible outcome as quickly as possible which went a long way in helping our family start to move beyond the tragedy. While I certainly never wish the same type of experience on anyone, I would without a doubt recommend Tony and his team for any matters of personal injury, accidents, or wrongful death. They are true professionals and importantly, they are also friends.

Being involved in an auto accident is mentally and emotionally draining not to mention any physical injuries one suffers and the financial impact that occurs as a result of injuries. My car was totaled.  I was injured and the other party was at fault with no valid driver's license and was an illegal alien.  The stress of my accident was completely relieved when I contacted and worked with Kalka & Baer, specifically, Alfred Evans.  He handled EVERYTHING  for me. He is the consummate professional keeping me informed all along the way until my case was settled...and to my complete satisfaction. At settlement Alfred made sure there would be no future repercussions for me too. I could now put this terrible experience behind me. Kalka & Baer far exceeded my expectations...and they are just the nicest people you'd want to meet.  I highly recommend them.

Tony was referred highly from a friend and did not disappoint.  I appreciate everything he has done for us and enjoy working as a "team" with him throughout this process.  Tony is always available to take your calls and spend the time necessary to answer any and all your questions.   I saw where he was awarded GA Super Lawyers in 2014.  This is definitely a well deserved honor.

So let me start off by saying that I have read every review on the sites my review is posted. Every single one has given this firm the maximum rating possible. That fact alone should reason enough for anyone with a traumatic life event occur that was not their fault to have Kalka and Baer work for them.    I was severely injured in a car accident due to absolutely no fault of my own. After reading amazing praise from reviewers on a few legal sites I decided to call them. Upon first meeting with Anthony Kalka at my home, as I was bed-ridden, he instantly made me feel relaxed. Mr Kalka and the other members of the firm throughout my dealings with them were always well informed, courteous, helpful beyond expectations. I also never felt pressured by them to do anything I didn't think was right and felt in control of my case. Nor was there any time that I could not reach Tony personally If had any questions. Due to the unbelievable work that Kalka and Baer did preparing for mediation with the insurance company, the proceedings went better than I could have ever dreamed. Mr. Kalka provided video testimony, detailed medical drawings, expert opinions, and a demand letter that was perfect. Thanks to these things and my legal team's diligence, I reached a settlement that was light years away from what I would have received from the insurance company without Kalka and Baer's help. I can't overstate how awesome these people are. If my review and every other perfectly scored review on this site don't convince you to have Kalka and Baer work for you, then I wish you good luck. Because you will not find a law firm that will do the things the wonderful people here will do for you and your case.

From the beginning, 7 days after my accident, Tony Kalka was the most professional and concerned attorney I had spoke with. Due to my injuries, Mr. Kalka met with me at my home. He was very candid and open with me, and no question I had went unanswered. Immediately I felt comfortable with him.My case went on for the better part of a year, all the while, he and his associates worked on building my case. Tony was also very instrumental in assisting me with managing my finances and getting the best medical care at the time. The due diligence exemplified by Tony Kalka and his staff is top notch, and, I feel, unsurpassed by not a single law firm in the Atlanta, or surrounding area! I owe total success in the case to his patience and understanding of all the intricacies involved with my accident. His knowledgeable staff is friendly and on top of everything. The efforts put forth by Tony and his colleagues allowed me to concentrate on my physical and mental recovery. I placed it all in his hands, and I was not let down!I have grown to look at Tony as a friend, and will use Kalka and Baer law firm in an instant in the future. Tony will not let you down; if you go in open minded, listen to what he says and follow his direction. I have and will continue to recommend Kalka and Baer as the premier injury trial attorneys in this region!

Toni and his firm took my case in June of 2013.  I was rear ended pretty bad by a truck.  I found the Kalka firm through reviews online and gave them a shot.  They quickly helped me find an orthopedic doctor and even helped me set up an appointment.  Toni kept me informed through out the case and was pretty honest with what I should expect from the case.  Overall I was very satisfied with everything Toni and his firm did for me.  I highly recommend the Kalka firm.

Two years ago, my husband was in an automobile accident. Tony was brought into our case because he had extensive knowledge and experience with trucking accidents. Right away Tony made us feel comfortable and told us not to worry. He had a genuine concern for what was best for us and was compassionate to all that we had been through. Tony has a love for people and is extremely passionate about his work and helping others. Tony went way above and beyond all our expectations and took care of everything for us, which in turn took all the stress away in what was a difficult time in our lives. He diligently kept us informed of everything that was going on with each step of the way. He handled our case with the utmost professionalism, integrity, attention to detail and friendliness. David and I will forever be grateful for everything you've done for us. We feel we not only have an Attorney for life but also a great friend for life. You're brilliant and thank you again for all of your hard work, David and I don't know what we would have done without you!!!!Forever Grateful,David and Ginger

Jason & Bradley took care of everything for me. After my accident I was not sure what to do. I called the office and the same day about 3 hours after the accident an attorney came to my home and helped me out since I couldn't drive to their office due to my injury.   After meeting with my attorney he insured me that he would take care of everything, and he did.  We filled out some paper work and I explained to him how everything happened and in 30 minutes my case was created.  He delivered exactly what he promised and then some. I would absolutely recommend Jason & Bradley to my family and friends.  My family and I can't thank you enough for the extremely professional and successful experience we had! Your team made a difficult time less stressful for our family. The financial compensation your team successfully secured for our family will greatly help us get thru. We will be referring Jason & Bradley to any of our friends and family.

I have been 100% satisfied with the outcomes in all of our dealings. You will not find a more honest and responsible attorney anywhere. In general I hate all attorneys...but I like Sid.

On behalf of my entire family we would like to express our deepest gratitude for all that your firm did for us during a very difficult process.Mr. Weinstein is a highly knowledgeable, professional, trustworthy, and effective attorney. He is determined and relentless in his representation, and his work is meticulous and thorough. The results he obtained in my case were far superior to my expectations. He was a true pleasure to work with, and he is the only attorney I will ever hire.

Mr. Weinstein helped me with a case last year. He was very persistent and diligent in representing me. He is easy to talk to and always accessible. Even at night. I highly recommend his services. If you want an attorney who is genuinely interested in taking care of your case and not totally focused on billing you to death he is your guy.

Mr. Weinstein has been fantastic to work with. He provides something that few lawyers do these days and that is the personal touch. He does not farm you out to some paralegal, or junior associate. If he takes your case, you can be assured you will work with Sidney Weinstein. This is up and above his expertise and tenacity as an attorney. I highly recommend Mr. Weinstein.

Mr.Stapleton is an excellent attorney and helped me tremendously by examining and explaining my case as well as what my options were and what the best possible choice for me to make would be. He is attentive and answered all my questions in terms I could understand and in a timely manner. He even continued reminding me of responsibilities I needed to fulfill after my case was complete and he had been paid so that I would not encounter a situation in which it was necessary to repeat my hearing and would require me to pay him again.

Working with Mr.Stapleton has been an awsome exprience.  His level of patience in explaining the step by step approach to filing a Chapter 7 takes away the whole stress and pschological trauma that is associated with the entire process.

I didn't know what to expect when I began searching for bankruptcy attorneys but after contacting Ted Stapleton I felt comfortable right from the beginning. He's a very knowlegeable and experienced attorney. He guided me from the first email we exchaged and then answered all my questions and concerns when we met in person. He explained every step of the way and what to expect during the process. I recently got my discharge letter and can't wait to start rebuilding my credit. I would highly recommend Theodore Stapleton PC and best of all, the fees are as reasonable as you'll find!

Top Notch Criminal defense.  Danny was very helpful in determining the best route of action for my wife and I to take when pursuing of lawsuit. He answered all of our questions quickly and professionally and handled our situation very well. Because of his knowledge we were able to achieve our desired result without even going to court. I would highly recommend using Danny to any of my friends.

Best Attorney I have ever worked with!!!! He is honest, professional, and a fighter. My legal issue was very sensitive and personal one. I have worked with other lawyers, and this experience was totally different because Danny treated me with respect and never made me feel like he was too busy to address all of my concerns. If you need a lawyer for your criminal case or for a personal problem I would recommend Danny because of his unique style and aggressive manner in which he handled my case.

He is the only attorney that gave me the time of day, was interested in my situation, and kept the needs of my family as top priority. I have tremendous respect for him and would recommend him above and beyond every other in the Douglas/Cobb/Carroll area. He's extremely intelligent and hard-working. I'm usually a difficult person to please and HIGHLY stubborn, but he kept my sanity in check, calmed my stubbornness, and showed me respect. He was very professional while dealing with my husband and was ultimately a fantastic mediator in the situation which actually lead to a total reconciliation between my husband and I. Like my title says, you really want this guy as your attorney.

Charles is the best attorney I've worked with. Always willing to speak with me and answer questions. He has handled 2 cases with GREAT success for me. Mandy is his paralegal and she is always on it! I would dare say the heart of the firm. I could not have done this without her. She didn't mind the many questions I had and always got me the answers very timely. Very helpful and informative. This practice handles your case with care and very professional. Both cases were great experiences and the outcome was better than I hoped for. They advised me all through the process and always gave me options. Thanks to McAleer Law Firm!

I can recommend this firm to anyone injured in a car accident (or any other injury, I guess) .   I had to get medical treatment for about 6 months after my car wreck (which was not my fault) and 2 weeks after my treatment, my case was settled for an amount that i think was very fair to me for what I had been put through.  Mr. McAleer was very concerned about my well being had my best interests at heart -- plus he was very easy to get on the phone -- a big plus!    My paralegal, Ashley, was the best.

Andrew Murphy and Richard Heslen handled a legal matter for me and I was 100% satisfied with the swiftness and expertise in which they handled my particular issue.  I had a very difficult legal situation where I had some heavy equipment stolen years ago. The police were unable to find the missing equipment.  Investigator Heslen went to Alabama and located the missing equipment in two days.  Then they successfully seized the equipment legally with the sheriff's dept. Then they went even further by pursuing the person who stole the equipment and they worked hand and hand with the prosecutor's office to make sure that the thief was prosecuted. I received complete closure in my case with the Andrew Murphy Law firm.  My money was well spent with them and I would highly recommend them to anyone,

Rickey is not just exceptional at his craft but very supportive as well. In my experience with Rickey, he not only kept me at ease with the legal process but he went the extra mile for my family to keep them aware and calm with the court process. Lastly, Rickey worked the process in a very methodical way as to give the system the proper time to do their job but not so much where it affected my long-term future. I would highly recommend Rickey for any of your lawyering needs.

Case Dismissed!Those were the final words I heard after countless court hearings with a disgruntled ex boyfriend. When I first went to visit Ricky I was frustrated, overwhelmed, and furious that I was slapped with a felony case.. I was greeted with a very calm and straight-to -the point demeanor from Ricky. His posture and easy-going vibe was just what I needed to keep me calm and assured that my case would be resolved with a positive disposition... Well today, I am writing my review because Ricky did just that!... He's no stranger to the court system or court room, and he was very assertive with my case even at times when I wanted to just throw in the towel. Today my case is dismissed and charges are dropped... I would recommend him to anyone who needs legal representation.

If you need an attorney that works hard for your case personally, Rickey is the one. He handled my DUI case and I was extremely happy with the outcome.

I was provided a referral to Mr. Rickey Richardson from a family friend. She told me that Mr. Richardson had been her families attorney for over 10 years. Mr. Richardson was a referral to her from a family friend that had worked with him for over 15 years. As you can see he comes highly recommended. That is why when my son made a very immature mistake and got into trouble with the law, I called Mr. Richardson.He gave me amazing information over the phone, got me in his office within 24 hrs of my call and was in court to represent my son within 24 hrs of my call. He made me feel as if I was his only case. His persona is very calming and reassuring, which is so comforting when you are in fear of your childs well being,.I cannot say enough about how wonderful Rickey Richardson is. Watching him in court left me speechless. He is well versed in the laws, articulate,aggressive,and well liked and respected by everyone at the courthouse. If you ever need an attorney who will treat you as if you are his only case and get you the results that other attorneys cannot, you need Rickey Richardson.

I had what some would call a “complicated” case. Which took time to sort out - many years in fact. Sometimes I wouldn’t hear from the office for awhile unless I contacted them first. I do think that this possibly could’ve been handled quicker. But like I said my case was complicated, they moved offices and then COVID - some delays that occurred we’re out of their control. Besides the delays - my encounters with Kevin and his team were always a delight. They were very professional, and took time to answer all my questions. We ended up getting a settlement for what I think I deserved and that was greatly appreciated. Worth all the time in the end. I would recommend them to a friend but hope they improve on regular and timely communication going forward.

I'm grateful to Kevin and his team of paralegals Kyle and Davis who helped us through the whole case. My case was complex however, Kevin and his team were able to resolve my case that started in 2018. During mediation and deposition, Kevin walked us through the whole process and prepared us for what the defense counsel was going to do and say. My case was resolved in mediation and Kevin always listened to our concerns and explained to us what was the best avenue and what to expect. The case was against Geico, and his posture never changed, thanks to that he was able to make Geico triple their initial settlement offer. I do not doubt that without Kevin and his associates Geico would have won even though they mistreated a loyal customer. I would recommend Leipow and Associates to does who need a great litigation firm.

Unfortunately, I was injured in an auto accident. I found myself in constant pain and confused as to what I should do. I finally decided to seek legal representation. I knew I didnt want to work with a huge firm that treats clients like a number. I was referred by friends to a wonderful attorney. He worked on my case but was unable to complete it due to severe health complications of his own. He spoke with Mr. Carpenter and Mr. Sammons on my behalf and they inherited a complicated mess of a case. I could tell right away that they were DIFFERENT! They treated me like a human being and were sympathetic to my specific issues. They will treat you the same way. Turns out the defendant's insurance were accommadating and amiable while MY OWN insurance company were the exact opposite. After an annoying battle, my case is finally over! I dont know what I wouldve done without S&C on my side! I highly recommend Sammons and Carpenter. They will work diligently to get your case settled...And If they cant reach a generous agreement with the defendant(or your own insurance company) They are fully prepared to represent you in front of a jury! A lot of attorneys dont concern themselves with actually going to court with you if it becomes necessary. The bottom line is this: If you want to be treated with respect and compassion by attorneys that actually care, Sammons and Carpenter areq perfect for you. On top of all that, they are also very reasonably priced-Most cases are on contigency basis, meaning you dont have to pay unless there is a favorable resolution to your case. Sadly, accidents happen everyday so if you are injured and you are not sure what to do, please give them a call right away.They have free consultations so they can help you decide whats right for your individual case:)

As a real estate agent as well as a partner in a real estate investment firm, I've certainly worked with my fair share of closing attorneys. After experiencing far too many unnecessary delays, title search issues, and let's say, ahem, "less-than-stellar" customer service, I was absolutely thrilled the day we completed our first closing at Harris Wagner Law Group. Since then, I've insisted that each and every closing in which I am involved happens at Harris Wagner. Without fail, the pre-closing process is smooth sailing every single step of the way, thanks to Harris Wagner's amazingly proactive and detail-oriented pre-closing team. When buyers, sellers, mortgage brokers, or other parties have changes or need assistance, Harris Wagner is as flexible, kind, and helpful as can be. Upon arrival in the lovely, calm and peaceful HW waiting area, the Office Manager is a pro at making sure everyone is comfortable and happy. And of course, the closing attorneys themselves are, hands-down, simply incredible. They have a knack for balancing professionalism with fun, taking the time to explain documentation, answer questions, and make the potentially-dreadful process of signing stacks and stacks of paperwork a true pleasure. Additionally, although you might expect high fees for such outstanding service, Harris Wagner's fees are extremely reasonable and competitive. I highly recommend Harris Wagner to anyone... the team here will do absolutely everything they can to ensure your real estate transaction is a successful, stress-free one.

My attorney Ms. Sunne would personally call me to find out how I am feeling and then would explain things to me and provide encouragement when I was down. Before I met her I had to pay for all of my expenses. When she took over my case my money was reimbursed. If not for her I might not have anything because my employer cared less. They were there for me throughout the case, gave me hope and fought to make sure that I got what was due to me. Ms. Sunne is my superhero

By far, my entire family's favorite movie theater in Atlanta.  Seats are super comfortable, and we love that we can reserve our seats in advance.

This is our preferred theater!  They have reserved seating and huge leather recliners!!  If you buy your tickets for the first showing on Saturday or Sunday, the tickets are only $7 each!!!!

My favorite movie theatre because it's so cheap! $5 for students at any time. And for everyone else, the prices beat any other theatre! Also, they serve food and drinks that they bring to your seat in the theatre!

My first time visiting the Movie Tavern at Northlake Festival was a great experience.  The theatre offered a lot of movie and food choices.  I caught a late Sunday afternoon movie and the pricing before 5pm was only $5.  I ordered a dinner meal and the food was served hot and delicious.  The price I spent on the movie and dinner ($13.50) was comparable to a fee that I would pay else where just for the flick.  A very peaceful environment, family oriented, clean and inviting.  Truly a wonderful experience for dinner and a movie.There needs to be more Movie Tavern's here in Atlanta, GA.Thanks,A very satisfied movie goer

YOU ALL SHOULD DO A CRIMINAL BACK GROUND CHECK ON THESE EMPLOYESS FROM NEW ORLEANS! I HAD THE WORST EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE @ THIS LOCATION! THE ASSISTANT MANGER IS RUDE AND NASTY! SHE DOESNT LIKE HER JOB OBVIOUSLY! I WILL NEVER REFER ANNO CONY ONE TO THIS PLACE BECAUSE OF THE TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE I HAD!!!!!!! THE BATHROOM IS NASTY, THE FOOD IS OLD AND NOT PREPARED AS ITS ORDERED! I EVEN SAW SMALL CRITTERS CRAWLING AROUND THE CONCESSION AREA! I BROUGHT IT TO THE YOUNG LADY ATTENTION AND SHE SHOWED NO CONCERN WHAT SO EVER! SHE ACTED LIKE IT WAS NORMAL AND SHE CARE LESS! UNLESS YOU LIKE BUGS IN YOUR BUTTERED POPCORN AND NASTY ATTITUDES FROM EMPLOYEES DONT WAISTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME!!!!!!!!!

I know theaters suffer losses when people are illegally allowed in movie theater, but if a fire breaks out in this theater, you could die. I watched the manager for the day LOCK the emergency door in our theater.. he even checked to make certain it wouldnt open.. the theater is actually ok.. I just hope there is no problem with the wiring.. cause the likelyhood of you getting out before smoke consumes you is nil

All I have to say is WOW about Big Cinemas at South Dekalb. I have never been to movie theater where they check your bag as if it was a nightclub. I was so taken aback when the employee asked to look in my bag, I didn’t know what to say and I just complied. My question is was that legal for them to search my bag? At that moment, I knew that I would never return to that theater again and that there is always a price for some things being cheaper. The price of a matinee was $6.50 but I will pay the extra $2 to $3 if that means that my bag will not be checked and I won’t feel so violated or like I am a common criminal. I am extremely disappointed in Big Cinemas; as a business owner if your concern is losing money than maybe you should up your ticket prices and the quality of your food to help with your loss prevention.

Before I walked into the doors, I thought this location was a bad place to go, BUT I was pleasantly surprise at this place.  My friends and I had drinks at the Jazz Bar before going into the theater to watch our movie. The Jazz Bar had a DJ and a bartender that made KILLER DRINKS! I didn’t order any food but was happy to know they offer real food (i.e. fried shrimp, etc). Afterwards we went into the theater to view the movie. Very spacious and clean.. I will be back and I would recommend this place to everyone.

This is a cool theater. I like the fact that it is right next to the mall. Other features are the table and chair setups. It is great for dinner or lunch and a movie. And the tables are family friendly.

My concern is with the cost of popcorn at this theater.  Although one could buy 1 large popcorn for 4 kids, it would be very unsanitary for them to all be dipping their hands into the same bag.  There should be small, reasonably-priced bags as an options.

Located in probably the worst mall in Atlanta, AMC North Dekalb is a hidden gem.  The best thing about this movie theater is the price!  $7 to see just about any movie! We all know how movie can go as high as $15 a pop so for half that price you can see it all.  Its usually croweded whenever there's a new release but there's ample parking.

We have been taking our pets to Crossroads Veterinary Hospital for about 20 years. They have a truly wonderful practice. Everyone is always friendly and helpful on the phone and in person. They are professional and very good with my large dogs and my cats. They always find time to see my pets for urgent care and take wonderful care of my animals when they board. The doctor's here really care about my pets and my family. I highly recommend this practice.

I would absolutely recommend Fido Fido Dog Daycare - we heard about them through a google search. They are great!
 -

Fido Fido has outstanding customer service. The dogs always come back exhausted from there- that is great. I have sent them a lot of referrals.
 -

I've been with Fido Fido since 2007 for daycare and boarding. I first started using them when I went out of town for a trip and have been with them ever since.
 -

 - 
A friend recommended Fido Fido to me when my dogs were puppies. I think the main thing that I like most about them is the staff. Elise and Ashton help me get the dogs when I'm picking them up and they know us.
 -

Taking my puppy to Fido Fido really helped me a lot. It helped to train her and she no longer chews things up. They are also open on Sundays which is convenient for me as well

We bring our dogs to Fido Fido at least once or twice a week. Everyone there is so friendly and helpful. We can always count on them.

Fido Fido dog Daycare has a good environment. When I go out of town I know I don't have to worry about my dog because I can bring her to Fido Fido and know that they are are looking out for her.

My dogs run happily into BH Lofts as though they are greeting long lost loves. And, in fact, the staff greet them with the same amount of love and enthusiasm! We appreciate that they treat each dog as an individual (with no prejudice against breed) and match playmates according to temperament and energy. Brooks (the manager) is the best!
 -

A friendly staff that has given great care to my dog when he boards there, even in his senior years.  And having grooming available is a big plus!

Brooks (manager) and the caretakers are very friendly and really care about the dogs.  I've used them for doggy daycare and for boarding.

We have used BHV Lofts for the last few vacations for our 3 yr old Lab, and she has loved it. She came back happy (and tired from all the playing with the other dogs), and freshly bathed. I just had our new puppy do his "preview" day there today (which is something they offer *free* to get your dog acclimated prior to their first scheduled boarding). He came home with his "report card" that clearly showed that the staff was paying close attention.Bonus: there are DoggyCams for you to peek in on your pooch when you're away.The staff is friendly, knowledgable, and clearly love dogs. Hours are convenient. Love them!

The staff here is phenomenal.    We go there maybe 2-3 times per month, but they know my dog by name and always welcome us with a smile.    They are incredibly accommodating... My dog once came in with a hurt foot and needed his foot soaked in a solution for 10 minutes per day, and needed to take two pills per day.    They did it all gladly! And even gave me updates :).

My puppy loves coming here for daycare! He loves playing with the other dogs, and comes home tired. He’s always happy, and excited to arrive!He receives excellent care from the friendly, professional staff! They greet him by name when he arrives, and he is happy to see his caregivers.We’ll continue to come here for daycare because of the excellent service!Definitely five stars! Thank you for taking good care of him!

This is my spot! They are always dependable and reliable. Customer service is great too, they’re really quick especially when you’re in a hurry to drop your pet off and go.

Awesome! Dr. Grant at Coral Sands is the best. I have been frequenting his office for as long as he has been there, 20 plus years. I moved to South Georgia about 5 years ago and I still drive 5 hours back to the Atlanta area to take my pets to this clinic. I recently had an emergency situation and as usual Dr. Grant had my back. In the 25 years that I raised and showed dogs I have never found another Veterinarian that respected my knowledge and judgement about my pets the way Dr. Grant does, and I appreciate that. Thanks for everything Dr. Grant and the staff at Coral Sands Animal Hospital.

you always feel comfortable knowing your family member(pets of choice) is taken care of.  Dr Grant is a vet who not olnly cares about your pet but has a rapport with you for the best interest of all.  He is economical, and flexible in his hours of operation.  my pets have been going to him for over 8 yrs.  I moved far far away and will travel to ensure quality care possible.

I brought Clio in, only, to get her ears cropped.  There was no waiting.  I was able to do a walk-in. The fees were very reasonable.  The Vet was very personable and friendly.  Clio will be going here forever.  It's a wonderful, clean, neat and professional Vet. clinic.

If anyone in Atlanta is looking for an awesome doggie daycare then I highly recommend Piedmont Bark. Puck and Rhett both love it there, and the staff (especially Sean) give them so much love and personalized attention and care. Plus when it comes to the canine flu in Georgia, they are super careful and haven't had any instances.
 -

Excellent doggie daycare.  I appreciate how they require a "trial day" to make sure all dogs your pup plays with have a good temperament.  Also good for overnight boarding.

We have a new puppy and we were desperate to find a place we could trust to take our new golden retriever pup when we both get busy with work as we sometimes do. Trevi has been going to doggy daycare at PB for 5 months now. We love that Trevi has a place to play while we work, and he loves it too. He can't wait to hop out of the car when we pull into the parking lot. The staff is so friendly and caring with Trevi and I always appreciate the great customer service that is given. If you love your dog and are looking for a place you can trust and a place that your pup will love too try Piedmont Bark. They also do a great job grooming and bathing our pup.

We have tried several places to have our dog groomed since moving to Decatur 4 years ago.  After several very mediocre haircuts / groomings we tried Furbustaers on a whim. Once I talked to the staff and they finished the grooming we were hooked!  Great caring staff, clean facilities, and it diesn't smell like a wet dog when you walk in.  Give them a try, we think you will love them too!

This place is great, I have been bringing my Dog Munchkin to them for quite some time now, they have great customer service, and the cutest little outfits and pet beds. They keep my baby looking beautiful and clean! They are the best in the area(believe me, I've been a few places)!See for yourself.

Well everyone knows my scooby he is a small dachshund with a horrible attitude. But they had no problem with him they got him in and out so i could continue with my day. They brushed his something he want let me do. So they get my vote. Very Good job. He will be a constant customer.

We board our girls here all the time.  Rosie is a more of your senior citizen, while Vixen is still a whole lot of puppy.  They always put the girls in the same suite so that even when they're not at home, they have the comfort of each other.  They practically bolt to the door whenever I drive up, and judging by their reactions on driving up to the vet, they must really enjoy their time there.

Our Labs, Buckeye and Scarlet are so excited everytime we pull in the parking lot. The staff at ADS truly cares about your dog. It is so great to check the Doggie Cams while we are at work to see what the dogs are doing. I love to check all of the rooms to see what is going on. I like to check in the Doggywood room to see all of the Mini's running around. Our dogs have been going to ADS since they were puppies and had all of their shots. It will be 3 years in March. ADS is a great way for your dog to get excercise and socialize with other dogs. I highly recomment ADS. I would give them 10 stars if it was an option.

Thank you so much for inspiring your cool Mom Sarah to open the Atlanta Dog Spa. I have been coming to the spa about twice a week for two years and then occasionally for weekend spa treatments. When I arrive in the morning, I usually flop on my back to receive a belly rub from Stephanie and then jump up to give Jorge kisses and hugs before heading back to the big dog play yard to greet my friends. One of my favorite activities is in the summer when I get to chase the water coming out of the water hose to cool off. My parents laugh at me when I do this at home so it is nice to be in a place where I am appreciated for just being me. I love the Atlanta Dog Spa and their amazing team and would encourage the parents of my K-9 friends to bring their furry children here because it is the best!!  Woof Woof,

Love, love. love Pupcakes.  They loved on our little Cookie and made her so comfy in daycare.  She played hard with the other pups and was nice tuckered out when we picked her up.   What a great job grooming too.  Our little ball of energy has a thick undercoat which was cleaned out.  She smelled so yummy I didn't want to let you outside ever again!   :-D

We took our 7 month old mini Goldendoodle here for his first haircut. He came out looking great and he looked like he was having the time of his life playing with the other pups when we arrived. The price was very fair for a wash, cut, and nail trim. We will definitely bring him back for his next summer cut!

We left our presious little pug at The Park over the weekend. The ParkCam showed me he was fine; actually having fun. I can't believe I found a place like this in Tucker. I came home on Sunday and actually got to pick him up. I've never left him anywhere else that allowed him to be picked up on Sunday, I just had to pay for another night. I am also excited that the staff is there 24/7! Thanks you for coming to the area and THANKS to the courteous staff - I'll definately be back

I love this place! Their staff is so incredibly sweet, smart and understanding. I called to get information on getting my cat spayed, the receptionist was incredibly kind, and patient with all my questions. She was very knowledgeable about what would happen, and gave me an estimate of the cost for her shots and spay. When I brought her in, the receptionist at the front desk, a different lady than the first I had talked to, already knew who we were and what to do, without even my having to prompt her with our information. The surgeon came in and told me all the information I needed to know. He and the assistant were both incredibly good at handling my girl and keeping her calm. She's naturally a bit of a scaredy cat (ha) and can be very skiddish around strangers. She was obviously very comfortable with the both of them. Dr. Holland is incredible. She came in, gave my girl a good look over, sent her into the back to get prepped, and ran over the costs for the procedure, which turned out to be the exact price I had been told in the beginning! How nice! I was given times of when everything would happen, and the assurance I could call anytime to check in.  My girl was picked up the next day, with no complications, and no surprise charges. She's at home and doing great now, and her scar is teenie-tiny! Dr. Holland also works with the humane society to do the low cost spay and neuter with the certificate, saying its how she feels she is "giving back." Dr Holland and her staff are truly such a blessing.  I will be using them as my vet from now on.
 -

This has to be the best Veterinary Hospital in East Cobb. Dr. Holland and her staff make the comfort and care of our furry children always 1st. priority.  My experience here have made a lasting impression and will keep me and my pets coming back for years to come. I wouldn't trust my precious babies with anyone else!

I have three small dogs that I take here for grooming every month.  They do a GREAT job.  The dogs look fantastic, the price is very comfortable for me and they are very timely.  If the groomer says a certain time for pick up, I can rest assured that all three of my pups are ready at that time.  I can't say enough about Love My Dog Grooming!  I highly recommend them to anyone who loves their dogs!!!

Taylor WilsonI would like to thank Mrs. Thompson with Dream Homes Consulting. I relocated from another state and needed an emergency move. I found Dream Homes Consulting to assist with my move and they went above and beyond to assist my family and I. We enrolled in the program and she provided me with the listing the same day we made the payment. She did virtual tours for my family and helped me get in contact with the agent of the home to complete the application process. I have major credit issues and thought I wasn't going to find a home and Mrs. Thompson worked for me and my family. I appreciate your dedication and assistance with helping me locate a home. Thanks Mrs. Thompson I appreciate everything you have done.

Went to Dream Homes Consulting for service to locate my family and I a rental property. I found they company by a referral. My friend went through the company and I took a chance on the company worked with my Consulting Rep Ms. Shelley and she assisted me with finding a home. I also joined the financial classes and the credit building class and I must say the plan is going great and my score have went up. The classes they offer teaches you a lot of money management. I love Dream Homes Consulting. Thanks again for the assistance I receive from this company.

From the first moment I spoke with Mrs. Thompson, she gave me the confidence I needed. I was moving from out of state and I wasn't able to really be here to view homes and we were moving in a 3 week period. Mrs. Thompson not only showed us numerous homes in details with pictures sent to my email the moment we entered her program, But she helped facilitate moving into a beautiful home. Its stressful enough relocating especially if you don't know the area. I recommend her service to anyone who has special requirements, but still need to move into a beautiful home. Thank you Mrs. Thompson!

She is sweet as can be! I love her meek yet professional character. Tiffany had to have patience to work with me! I asked her a million questions and I would lose track of time and email or text her wayyyy after working hours. MS Tiffany always responded and gave me an answer to my question. I had a very lengthy complicated process of obtaining financing, but I had the right realtor ( MS Tiffany Richardson). She is still working on some things in my home and we closed on December 28,2015.I loved the professional services this charming and energetic lady provided. Tiffany Richardson is highly recommended by me because she was very instrumental in me becoming a happy homeowner!!!

Helped my family find the best rental management companies for both my Panama City beach and Gatlinburg vacation rental properties. Excellent customer service and this brilliant concept made for an all-around great experience. I would recommend their service to anyone who owns a Vacation Rental.

I am going to give some feedback on this company. I was referred to them by a good friend of mine because our community was self-managed. We were in desperate need of a management company. I gave them a call and they emailed me some information and I gave them a call back and set up a meeting. All went well, actually all went very,  very well. We really needed to get some collection processes in play from old assessments that haven’t been paid in a couple years. That was our main concern. They have a collections department that was very reasonably priced and they took affirmative action and we are seeing results now as we speak. So although we have hired them and it’s only been a few months we are seeing the change in the community and some change in the HOA Bank account. I would say give them a shot. You won’t regret it.

I just wanted to leave some feedback for this company because they are actually the best management company I have dealt with. To sum it all up, we have just signed on with this company to manage my HOA and within 4 months we are already seeing change and a positive response in the community. They are going above and beyond to help are community bounce back. They also have a collections department that works. Literally they are making progress in collecting pass due assessments from homeowners who have failed to pay for a year or 2 in our community. I would recommend you give this company a shot. It is well worth it. They definitely do some quality work.

I am the current President of my board for my HOA in Lilburn, Ga. When we voted to have Horizonz manage our community, it was the best decision we made. For years prior we thought we had a good management company, but I won't reveal the name of that company as we are trying to forget them and the many ways they bamboozled us for so much money. Once Horizonz came aboard we saw an immediate change in our budgeting and community affairs. They have better vendors and they are always on top of any issues we have, which aren't many anymore. Not to bore you with a lengthy review I will get straight to the point to be made. Hands down I would recommend this company to any friend who lives in a community with an HOA. They are very affordable and you will get the best bang for your buck. They always go above and beyond. Thank you so much Horizonz.

I have recommeded several people to Midtown Properties because I lived there 3 years as a foreign student and a graduate researcher at Georgia Tech.  The company ,due to it's Director, Ms Elaine, is very professional.  Most of the company's apartment buildings are located in MIdtown and Buckhead.  Some are older ,yet all are luxurious including a new multi million dollar project which has all of the modern amenities and I would say,is the best property in the entire area in my opinion and the  opinon of 4 people I recommeded who all stayed there and loved it.
 -

 - 
The apartments are very nice and located ideally suited to easy access to anywhere,i.e.,entertainment,shopping,arts,shops and the best parks.  The neighborhood features some million dollar mansions and Midtown Properties has one of the most magnificent new mansions with marble and granite baths,steam showers,gormet kitchens,chefs pantry and more. All properties have off street parking.  It is like living in the Hilton or Ritz all year round and for a great price. Compare rooms and studios to the Ritz at $200 and up per night. You can pay only $250 a week.

I was looking for a solid company to manage my rental property.  All of the other companies I spoke with were trying to charge me some ridiculous fees.  I tried to manage the property on my own at first but it became a hassle and took too much time away from me and my family.  The tenant was always late or sometimes didn't pay at all.  After sitting down and speaking with one of the associates from Community-Wide, I felt comfortable with their services.  I felt like they were not going to treat me a certain way because I only had one property.  They made me feel like I was a large company and they were going to make it happen for me.  I have moved to California and Community-Wide is still taking care of me.  I appreciate everything they have done and really going the extra mile to take care of the "little" people.THANKS!!!

Mr. Pressley is the best home inspector that I have ever used.  He is very thorough and knowledgably.  He always make you feel that he is working for you.  "One Call, That's All" and it will be handled.

I have owned in my lifetime 12 homes.  Thus, I have had 12 home inspectors.  Mr. Pressley by far was the best Inspector I have ever had.  He has over 30 years of experience, and he teaches you what to look for.  He is very thorough, affordable, an a genuinely honest professional. He is a seller's worst nightmare.

I have had a wax pass for the past two years. European Wax Center is worth it. My skin looks better and feels more smooth since I've been going to them. I appreciate the appointment reminder calls and the skin tips during my sessions. The estheticians have a high level of professionalism and are friendly and passionate about keeping my skin healthy.

I love European Wax Center in Brookhaven! Amazing customer service, the girl at the counter even took about 20 cents out of her wallet so she could give me a dollar bill back....I didn't have much change so I went to my car to see what I could wrangle up to give her. I know it is not much, but just the thought that someone would space even a few cents to give me more back is so sweet. The waxers are great, i have had a few different ones. Even at the EWCs in Las Vegas, all the waxers are always friendly and make you feel really comfortable. Considering the situation :)I love EWC's hard wax too, the blue wax is great and wayyy better than paper strips!! EWC4life!

Hands down this is the best law firm that I've used. Ms. Mathis and Mr. Carpenter was very helpful throughout the entire case. I mainly was assisted by Ms. Mathis and she was great. Any time I had a question or concern she gave me a clear explanation. Response times were phenomenal. I've never had to sit and wonder if they received my email message or phone call. I'm  still amazed at the service and outcome of my case. I know 5 stars are the max that you can rate  a company but they truly deserve 10+ stars. Thank you again for providing excellent service. I will definitely refer any of my friends/family that's in need of legal assistance to your firm. Continue the great work and I hope you all continue to thrive.

Used these guys to help me with my offer in compromise. They filed tax returns and reduced my back tax debt. I am now in great shape and saved thousands.
 -

First I would like to say that I am completely at fault for falling so far in my back-taxes. I was w-2 then 11 years ago switched to 1099. Needless to say, I couldnt afford my taxes due. I waited and waited but was never able to catch up. One day I was hit with a bank levy and wage garnishment. I called Anderson Bradshaw Conusltants because enough was enough. They stopped the garnishment within two days. It took longer(of course) to completely fix my tax mess, but they did. Completely honest and worth it. definite recommend!!

I am a truck driver and have been for 25 years. For the past 10 years I went without filing my taxes. I have back taxes, a levy, A bank Levy, And my wages were about to be garnished. I called Anderson Bradshaw consultants and within seven hours they stopped my bank levy. And released my wage garnishment. I am on the road to being settled with the IRS and state taxes. Also, I can go back to work without any worry.

I didn't get what I thought I would get when I paid for my daughter's tax case to be handled by this group. She ended up paying as much as she would if we had just done it ourselves. I should have just kept the $3000 I spent with them. Didn't meet expectations they set up front. Not a good experience.

I was a bit nervous at first trusting a company I found online to help me with taxes, but John immediately put me at ease. I owed over $75,000 to the IRS and had a number of missing tax returns and the IRS had already put a wage garnishment on my pay and had just hit my bank account for a sizable chunk of change. Within 24 hours of signing up John put me in touch with an ABC Attorney who got me my money back from the IRS and stopped the wage garnishment. I was kept informed throughout the process and every step was explained to me to make sure I knew what was happening. At the end, I only ended up having to pay the IRS $2,500. I cannot recommend Anderson Bradshaw enough.

I had not filed for 13 years!!!!! I decided to get married so I had to file but didn't have any w-2's or payroll tax information or deductions. Anderson Bradshaw took care of all of that for me. Now I am all caught up on my taxes and it feels great. I didn't even have to do a thing.

I came to Anderson Bradshaw with a $36,000 tax liability. After speaking with Mr. King, he put me in good hands with Josh Kronick. He immediately protected me from IRS Collection action, informed me every step of the way for what to expect from the process, and ultimately delivered me an Offer-in-Compromise that settled my tax burden for $500. I cannot recommend this firm enough. They gave me a fresh lease on life. Thank you!

When we received a letter from the IRS saying my daughter owed them over $18,000 for income in 2013, we nearly had heart attacks! Her U.S. income in that year was only around $5,000, because that was the year she started teaching in Asia. Calls to the IRS gleaned only a little information, but it appeared that an ex of hers had accessed her PayPal account, sold his products online, but not forwarded the information to her nor did he tell her about it. I found Anderson Bradshaw online, contacted them, and after working with Josh and Ted for a short period, they managed to get it all cleared up and proper paperwork filed to clear her of all liabilities. We could not have done it without their help, and I will be eternally appreciative.

I am a United States Navy Veteran, who recently found himself in hot water with IRS . They wanted all these old returns and W-2' s that I haven't seen in years . I called around for help but the tax preparers could only go back 2 years. The other tax firms wouldn't return my call. It was only when I contacted Anderson Bradshaw and spoke to Ted England that I was finally able to get the help that I needed. I am not some rich guy or some huge company ; however, Ted was willing to take the time to get my issue resolved. Thanks to Anderson Bradshaw Tax Consultants I am finally able to get my life back from the IRS.

I was paying the IRS $400 a month for 2 years and I was getting NO WHERE!  When I initially set it up I didn't realize how much they charged for penalties and interest.  It's down right criminal (but that's whole different story) Last summer, things got pretty tough for my wife and I, we were robbing Peter to pay Paul and we just couldn't keep up with the payment any longer.  I had spoke with a few companies a couple years back when all of this started, but they didn't seem like they could offer too much help.  Thankfully I found Anderson Bradshaw through YP and I'm really happy that I did!  I spoke with Ted, he was very patient and answered all of my questions through out the consultation. He explained our options and mapped out a step by step outline of how they were going to resolve our case. There's finally a light at the end of the tunnel for us and they saved us quite a bit of money in the end.  Thank so much for ending this nightmare & getting us that Fresh Start you promised

When I began my search for a tax attorney, it was my understanding  "serve this area" would have been completed in the state I resided.  My paperwork made it across the country from Los Angeles, California to Baltimore, Maryland.  The same paperwork had to be submitted twice, one for each office.   I would have felt more comfortable if the paperwork could have been handled once.   I know that I would have felt more confident  if I could have worked with the same person the whole way through the process.

I cannot recommend ANDERSON BRADSHAW highly enough. There is always a courteous person to answer my questions and I personally work with Bill Davis most all the time. He has dealt with all my inept questions and queries. My account is not completely settled but is moving right along and the results are definitely are meeting my approval! My husband and I had ourselves in a real mess and they are getting things worked out really well. If you have any doubts about this company...don't hesitate to HIRE THEM ASAP!

I'm happy to write this review. I called ABC Tax two months ago when the IRS put a lien on my home and levied my wages. I was in $85,000 in debt to the IRS from when I started my own business many years ago. I never made any money in that business and now the IRS is threatening to take everything I have. As soon as I was transferred to Jeff, he put my mind at ease.  He is very knowledgable about tax help and tax resolution. He told me that he can stop the levy that day. and that I could settle my tax bill for only 5k. You guys did what you promised and now that I am paying back my reduced amount, The irs is removing the lien on my home and now I have a fresh start.

My wife works as independent contractor and we got careless about quarterly deposits so after about 2 years we owed way too much. We looked around and this guy calmed us down and was able to get us some kind of compromise with the IRS  and payments that we can now afford. yes, we recommend them.

A tax preparer whom I have worked with for years turned out to be stealing from me. Michelle Moya Pearl stole my stimulus money, opened fraudulent accounts using my identity, and screwed me on my latest tax return when I began connecting the dots. Absolutely scandalous, this company is well aware of her wrong doings. Don't trust these people with your information or money.

Being legally bound to financial jargons all my life, I faced some tax evasion issues last year where I was going to be rendered superfluous by the court if they had acquitted me. Even though I was right in my own terms, with the help of OMG Tax, they efficiently discovered the fissures in the data I kept. It was truly an astounding experience.

I was very impressed with this food! It's fast food but I felt the quality was on par with a sit down seafood place. The fried shrimp were big and very tasty and the fried clams were awesome. I expected them to be small and chewy but it was just the opposite. Coleslaw and hush puppies were very good too. Can't beat it for the price.

I contacted Roto-Rooter about a basement sink problem that arose when doing a routine load of laundry.  They had a tech at my house within 2 hours--Aaron.  He was extremely professional, kept me informed of everything he was doing and why, gave me several options and solutions as well as prices.  He had to call in another person--Greg--to do a camera scope of the underground pipes.  Greg arrived within 30-40 minutes of Aaron calling for his assistance.  Greg also was extremely professional, knowledgeable, and kept me informed of the procedures he was taking to evaluate the situation.  These guys ROCK!!!  Not only were they timely in getting to my house, but they were genuinely helpful with assessing the problem, fixing what needed to be fixed immediately, as well as giving me my options and prices.  I did not feel pressured to make an immediate costly decision; I did not feel like I was being ripped-off by some huge company that was only interested in making money and moving on to the next call.When I initially contacted the company for a service call, the young lady that took my call was very helpful and pleasant and genuine.  She knows what customer service is all about--making me feel like I was the only one with a problem today and that she could assist in getting it taken care of!!!!  And she did . . . I cannot say enough about Aaron and Greg.  Roto-Rooter is lucky to have them; they are proactive in tracing the source of the problem, getting the right equipment to the house immediately, and giving the customer options and prices and a base level of knowledge about what the homeowner's problem really is.  That is well worth the cost of the call!!

We had a wonderful experience with Roto-Rooters.  It was my daughter's 2nd birthday and we were celebrating with family in the house.  My uncle happened to notice that there was water leaking in the basement and it was filling up fast.  I called Roto-Rooter and they were out at my house within the hour and had the situation under control.  They quickly diagnosed the problem, gave me my options and saved my basement....and my daughter's birthday celebration.  I would call them again in a heartbeat if I needed them.  Very courteous, professional and knowledgeable.

I was very pleased with the service from Roto-Rooters! Their phone manners were fantastic and the technician was pleasant and worked quickly, efficiently, and was completely thorough in all inspections in ensuring everything was running properly. They also offered a warranty for the fix so if anything goes wrong in the near future, I'm covered for all costs. Every repair was explained so I could understand and I am confident that the problems are fixed for good. I definitely recieved roto-tastic results!

Mark was on time, dressed in a uniform along with booties over his shoes to come inside. I then explained to him it was a Rental house behind my house. The pipe for the toilet going thru the concrete floor, inside a walk-in basement, was clogged and I have electric and hot water available for him to use. I know that made his attitude towards the job better, instead of having to say work in a crawl space. I also worked with him, helping when I could. Holding a light, turning the water on to flush the line or tools off, cause sometimes a third hand is useful. But either way, he was able to cut thru the tree roots that had grown into the pipe. Very courteous young man and a fine representative of your company. I will call you again if needed. I had called 3 other places and they either didn't return my call, too busy and referred me to someone else, that also didn't return my call. Saw one of your trucks and the rest is history. Thanks again, Rusty Salmons.

We have had the same plumbing problem (drains clogging up every few months) for 10+ years and have had at least a dozen plumbers in all of whom had no idea what was causing the problem.  Yesterday Jolly Plumbing sent a young man named Cody out and within 5 minutes or so he discovered the source of the problem.  Cut a small hole in the under sink area where the problem was, took care of it, and replaced the cutout with a nice looking little cover/door which will give easy access to any possible future problems.  Was extremely impressed with his knowledge, work ethic, and desire to actually get to the bottom of the problem and get it resolved.  Can't say enough about that young man.  Will not only use Jolly in the future if need be, but will tell everyone about them and Cody.  William Isaac

They are GREAT!!!  They are always very friendly and always on time.  No time was ever lost having to get a part.  They worked fast and know what they are doing.  With the work they did on my old house, they added thousands to the value of my home and increased the selling price!!!!  I had the builder put in rough in's in my new house because I know I can trust the work of Calla Plumbing.  Great Service, Great advice and they delivered exactly what I needed.  CALL CALLA PLUMBING !!!!!

Complete Re-pipingI purchased a house that had copper thieves steal all the piping. I needed the work done right-a-way because we were going to use the house for ourselves immediately. Jim Kroeger Jr. came over as soon as we took possession, he gave us a fair estimate and started work the next day. I was very impressed with how efficient Jim was with minimizing fittings and elbows which look bad, cause noise and cause pressure drop. Also he didn't forget the extras like valves for a humidifier and the ice maker. Another extra he helped us with was bringing the gas lines up to code. I'm really pleased and I'm calling him back when we add a bathroom.

I've had trouble with my sewers for years.  A neighbor gave me Jim Kroegers name and phone number.  He was there in a very timely manner and worked until my drains were running free and clear.  Excellent results.  I gave his name to my neighbor who had some one else clean the drains and called him because the drains were still running slow and he did the job better and somewhat cheaper.  I've had Jim and his sons back several time for different things and always with excellent result.  A hard working company.

I have been extremely pleased with the service from Tri County Plumbing Heating and Air!  They’ve done countless jobs for me over the years, including replacement of my water heater, furnace, a/c and multiple plumbing jobs.  I have dealt with a lot of businesses with home projects and Tri County Plumbing continues to outperform the others.  Thanks to Gary and crew for being the best in the business!

Our water main broke in our house late Sunday night.  The water co came and turned off our water at the meter that night.  On Monday morning I called Tri County Plumbing and they had a guy out here by noon to hook up a temporary water line so we could have water till they came back on Wednesday and installed our new water line with very little damage to our lawn.  They were quick and efficient.  They gave me an estimate when they hooked up the temp line, but I did not get other estimates as I was happy that they could do the work so quickly.  I told them that I was writing this because people usually only rate a company when they are not happy with them.  We should pay compliments to those who do good work.  We had a different company repair our sewer line and they trashed our yard in areas they weren't even working in.  Gary W. and his crew were very considerate of the landscaping.  We would definitely hire them again.

Had a wonderful experience with Hofmeyer!  We had a leak in the water pipe from the house to the street.  We have watched countless neighbors have their yards dug up for similar issues, and were really worried about damage to our yard.  Hofmeyer quoted us at half the price for total replacement of the pipe and used a special drill to put the pipe in through the house without digging up the yard.  They took the time to dig up the grass and contain the dirt in the small patch they dug to connect the pipe.  They refilled the hole, put the grass back down, and even cleaned the sidewalk.  You can't even really tell they were ever here.  They showed up on time and worked like crazy until it was done.  So impressed with their professionalism.  Highly highly recommend this company!!!!

they know what theyre doing here thats for sure, and they cost less than anywhere else around for a job you know will be done the right way. my kitchen looks excellent after they finished it, along with the bathrooms. even after tearing up my whole backyard, two weeks later you couldnt have known Hofmeyer Plumbing did a job here, everything looked perfect, no mess, no flooded backyard. EXCELLENT

I hired Archer Plumbing to replace an old, leaking hose bibb and install a new one on the other side of my house.  The plumber arrived promptly and went to work immediately.  He was very courteous and informative of questions I had.  When he was finished with the job, he cleaned up any mess he made and instructed me on the use of the hose bibbs.  He even instructed me on how to winterize them for the winter (not too many plumbers would think that far in advance when you're sweltering in the summer heat)!When I received the bill, I was even more surprised, the cost wasn't as much as I thought it would be.  Since then, I've hired Archer Plumbing to do other jobs at my home including toilet work and augering.  I've found that they are very competitively priced and easy to deal with.  They work around my schedule and always call me to let me know when they are on their way.  I highly recommend them!

The IRS in Cincinnati is a joke. I have called Ms Hampton numerous times. No phone call back. However she feels she can take money out of MY bank account for my fiances taxes. I am not married and they have no right to go after my money. I was told a week ago if i fax my pay stub the funds will be released. A week later no call back and no money. Its a joke. I will be their mondayvyp speak to a supervisor. Unacceptable that IRS tbinks they are above anyone else!! What a joke!

Don't bother to call, they never answer the phone and it IS during business hours. If they are so busy, get an answering machine like the rest of us! If it's that important that we pay our taxes, they should make themselves accessible!

Unbelievable Service, I Will Never Look For Another Attorney....I'm SoldFor all who is reviewing this review.......How many times have you gone to attorney and was told one thing and another thing happened? Bottom line....I was told certain steps would take place and this would be the retainer fee. WOW.....to my amazement, Adam and Kristin Russell done exactly what they said "Completely To The T". Even I thought with the case in front of me that it can't be this simple. But, to my amazement, not only did it, but they exceeded what was stated to me. Hopefully moving forward, I'll never need an attorney again. But, if I ever do, you can assure yourself that they will be my first and only call. Adam and Kristin, thank you so much for your hard work and dedication to my case and making me feel calm and relax during the entire process.Respectfully, Mark

Cutest theater ever. Loved the location. We saw a documentary about Amy Winehouse there. The staff was very friendly. We noticed on our way further into the theater that there was an area that sold wine and cheese, as well as fancy desserts. I thought that was nice and appropriate for such a small theater house.

I want to give a great review regarding the Mariemont Theatre. It had been yeeears since I had been to this theatre.I want to say I met a friend there and went to one of the movies. The concession was small but the service and available food was just as good as going to the larger theatres. The whole experience made for such an enjoyable evening. It just felt it was just as nice as going to the big theatre, but the plus of being small and having such character!This surely shows how important it is to support and  keep some of the older memorable buildings and businesses around.

I ordered a Santa letter and personalized book on 12/7/09.  The letter came Dec 23...the book never did come. It was a promised gift to a friend's child. The Web site lists an unoperative phone number, 8 letters and E-mails have been ignored. Too bad, I had found them at a craft fair in Indy and loved the products, someone responsible should be running this site...it had a lot of potential. For now it's simply a rip off.

Wonderful veterinary hospital! After getting a new dog and not having a vet in town I was weary of where to take her but I found Erlanger Vet and am so glad I did. The doctors are so great and spend their time with you without making you feel rushed at all.

The entire clinic is very much focused on the experience of the animals - as it should be - and it shows. The clinic itself is very nice and well designed, and the care offered to the animals is top notch.

I've been to several vets in the area over the years, but for the past several years now, I only go here. Great friendly staff, more affordable than most others, great vets...what more do you need?!

The office was very easy to locate. I didn't have any trouble finding it at all. One thing I did enjoy was the waiting room chairs. They were comfortable and I didn't mind waiting in them for the appointment. I appreciated that they were still concerned about my health even after I left the office. They followed up with me after my appointment and everything. I've never seen anyone who is more respected by their staff. The entire staff only had great things to say about working there, and it made me want to return all the more.  They never have that typical, annoying music playing here. If they do play music it is soothing and appropriate for the setting.

Jennifer does a great job! Our adopted dog Dusty has an unusual personality. Jennifer knows so much about canine behavior. I think Dusty actually likes going to the groomer and he knows he looks very handsome. I feel so lucky to have found Wags and Whiskers.

I have been taking my dog to Dog Day Every Day in Beechmont for several months now.  I wish I was able to give them 10 stars.   They treat her like a family member.   I know that she is treated well because she drags me to their front door when we arrive.   Every member of their staff is friendly, attentive and makes you feel welcome.  I love the fact that she is never in a crate.  She has become a very social dog.  She is worn out when she get home.
 -

Dog Day Every Day is awesome! they are great folks at both locations and truly love your dog.  i know that my dogs are cared for (better than I am at work!) and they play all day - sleep very well at night! I would recommend this day care to anyone who wants a loving place for thier extended family while they are gone!
 -

 - 
Dog Day Every Day is the best thing that happened to my furry friend!  Suzanne and her crew at the Beechmont location all treat their doggie guests like royalty.  I really prefer boarding my spoiled pup at Dog Dog because the dogs are not kept in kennels, and someone stays with them 24/7 - they even get to sleep on the bed!  The doggie daycare service provides valuable socialization for my dog, and she comes home happy and tired!

This is a great place to board your pets. The owners are so nice and give my pet, Ginger the royal treatment. She loves it there. When I drive up she starts doing her happy barking. Hillary is the best. It's clean, safe, and they really go above and beyond to make your pet happy.

In the process of planning our vacation, we were in search of a place to board our "rather wild and crazy" boxers Lucy & Harley. We wanted to find a place that would not just board our boxers but play with and them and give them the attention they need. We visited Captain Dogs Petcation before our vacation and were so impressed. The kennels are sparkling clean, they have better televisions to watch animal planet on than we have in our home, and a large play room with lots of toys to play with. The staff was wonderful with our bouncing boxers and made friends immediately. During our vacation we called to check on our dogs,  the staff gladly gave us updates and we were able to enjoy our vacation knowing our beloved pets were being well cared for. The next time you have a boarding need try Captain Dogs Petcation, I think our dogs had just as much fun on their vacation as we did! You will not be disappointed.

Loyal customer of over 20 years. My husband took his first pup there when he was 10 years old and he's never gone anywhere else. Now he has his license, so he gets to drive our pack of four there every month or two. They treat our pets as their own. I recommend them often to friends and family. I wouldn't trust my pets to anyone else.

Excellent service and great grooming.  Took my 9 month old shih tzu there and they did an amazing job and he was treated so well and came home very happy.  Will take my little guy there from now on and would recommend them to any one with a dog that wants a quality cut and the whole treatment for a reasonable price.

I highly recommend Dr. Stratemeyer.  He and his staff have a genuine care for their furry patients.  He's not the kind of  Dr. who will sell you out on a bunch of unnecessary  products or over medicate just to make a buck,  he honestly is concerned about the well being of your animals.  For the quality of care they offer, prices are according.  I  will be a long standing client at the Evendale Blue Ash Pet Hospital.

You want to adopt an animal you want to rescue an animal.. You want A EXTREMELY UNIQUE PET STORE/ANIMAL RESCUE then you need to go check it out.  For 15 years I though they just adopted out dogs.

My dog has been going to Doggie Day Care for over 7 years and to the kennels for  boarding for 8 years.  There is no where else that I would trust my dog with then the staff at Animal Ark.  The day care is her favorite place to be.  I do not mention the word day care to her in the morning that she will be going since she won't eat andstands by the door waiting to go.  This is the best place to socialize your dog.I highly recommend Animal Ark for all your animals boarding or day care needs.

Our two dogs have been going to doggy day care for a few years.  Since the small dog day care opened they have been going twice a week.  They absolutely love it.  It is a great opportunity for them to socialize with other dogs and other people outside the family.  This is especially important for our younger skittish dog.  He loves all the people at animal ark and is extremely excited to go.  Both our dogs ar exhausted when they come home but can't wait to go again.They also both get groomed at animal ark.  The groomers do an excellent job - we have never had a bad haircut and when we bring in a picture with a different look, the dogs are cut perfectly.  We have been going to animal ark for about 5 years and have found no one else as good.

OMG! You will love this place! They have premier service - anything you need for your furbaby while you have to be away from home. The staff get to know & remember you & your pet - all your needs, habits, routines. All special needs are taken care of like medicine, special diet, special cuddle time, grooming & exercise. No hideous cages! Just clean private rooms with clear doors (no bars). TV optional. They encourage you to call & check as often as you like to see how your pet is doing. Best of all, in my opinion, there is a staff person there 24 hours a day! You can't find that even with your Vet!!! It is a very special place you must see to believe! Safe, locked facility with hygienic indoor huge play area that serves as their "park" for play & potty. It is cleaned & dried between play sessions. Ingeniously planned & executed! Dogs love it! They also care for cats & birds.

Outstanding compassionate care.  My cat was suffering from end stage kidney disease and I had to make the painful decision to let her go.  The care was so wonderful and I am so grateful to Companion Care.  Andrea and Gina on the front desk were so caring.  Dr. Roemer was incredibly compassionate and I felt peace knowing my little baby was safe on her final journey.

I went there for the first time today, my regular vet is near my home which is 40 minutes from here but I found a cat near my work which is in Fairfield so I called and they got me in right away and I have to say normally I hate going to a new place especially with my pets because you just don't know what you are going to get but these people were GREAT! They were all very helpful and knowledgeable and I will definitely go back. The facility was very nice and clean and I just can't say enough for the staff......

From a renter's perspective, RPM Midwest is a great company to work with to find your new home. Needing to downsize, and having only a month or so to move after the sale of my old home, I searched for rental properties online and made inquiries about several different homes from various rental companies.  RPM was the only rental agency to actually contact me back, and they reached out to me in less than a day after sending my initial inquiry. Rental Agent Bonnie Louis did a great job in finding the time to show us the house and to work out the details of the lease within the necessary timeframe.  And, it's a beautiful house in a fantastic subdivision too! I've had to use RPM's online maintenance request portal just one time due to a furnace issue, and the response time and follow-up to the problem was fantastic.  No more dealing with landlords who ignore problems and take weeks to fix things.  A furnace repairman was there within hours. Good job RPM Midwest team!

I am renting a house they manage for a private owner. I have two Dobermans, which makes finding a decent rental property a challenge. If the property accepts large dogs, they usually don't accept my "aggressive" (eye roll) dogs. RPM worked with the owner to ensure that the lease was amended to specifically allow two Dobermans, which I appreciated.

After achieving initial contact with an agent, our experience has been a positive one. This is the first time we have rented through a leasing agency and the logistics of RPM have made it an easy process.

I absolutely love Real Property Management. My leasing agents name was Amber and Amber was very nice, knowledgeable and extremely helpful. Anytime I asked a question or needed a call back she responded  right away. From the moment I viewed the property with Amber I knew I would be pleased with their service. Before I had even filled out the application Amber and I talked about the color in one of the bedrooms and she was able to get the owner to repaint the room for me....awesome!!! My experience with this company has been nothing but pleasant. They are extremely helpful, very prompt in returning your calls, efficient and on time maintenance staff. The office staff is very professional and friendly. Julie who works in resident services is the most amazing, helpful and nice person I've every worked with in my leasing history. She is compassionate, understanding and just and all around good hearted person. She has made communication between me and the owner very easy. No matter what it is, Julie will make sure she communicates with me, helps or even follow up with me on any question or concern that I have. As I stated before, my experience with RPM has been a very pleasing one. I happy I found my home with them and I am renewing my lease with them another year. Between Amber and Julie and everyone in between I am sure I'm in good hands.

Having worked with other property managers I can easily say RPM is the best property management company around Cincinnati. While I’m not sure any property manager will ever meet the expectations of its owners, RPM comes pretty close. The prices are fair, services is better than anyone else, and most importantly, you can trust them. I would highly recommend RPM.

I moved into my rental about 1 1/2 months ago and at first was leery about going with a property management company versus a landlord. But I can tell you that’s been the number one reason I’m happy with them. They answered the phone when I needed to get my dishwasher fixed and got someone out here right away! So far, everything has been great with Real Property Management.  Viewing the property was even a really easy/convenient experience.  The staff has communicated well by email for the lease signing and payments (including issues with the payment portal- they were very helpful getting set up) The house is clean and we are happy!

They made the initial lease signing very easy and even met me to see the place a couple times before signing.They keep the property in great condition They are easy to contact if there is an maintenance request and everything is handled in a very timely manner. They also provide online services for rent payment, service requests and and even have a rep to chat with for any questions.I have thoroughly enjoyed living in a property owned my RPM!

I have no complaints about ASAP Properties, LLC because they did it quickly just as they said they would and Shannon was so easy to talk to and keep me updated every few days until ready to sign the end papers. The cash offer was a better offer than using a realtors and picky buyers. I could not afford repairs or could not empty the house and they did it for me. I am thankful they are experts that take pride in what they do. I would highly suggest them to anyone I know.

An honest statement about Fath Properties.These apartments are advertised as “a clean quiet place to live”. How far from the truth that was! Children of all ages run up, down, behind and in front of apartments and parking lots at ALL times of day AND night. Banging basket balls against the apt walls outside screaming and hollering at each other.The Fath Managment Compony Way:Having the gate malfunction and damage your carHaving your car towed for damage caused by said gateBeing charged late fees, because a property manager was on vacation and left a check on her deskWildlife such as rats, mice, bugs and even squirrels in your Fath homeWaiting 2-3 month for the “pest control guy” for who you pay a monthly feeHaving you apartment flood, repeatedly!Waiting 8 month for maintenance to repair a leaky sink only to move out and be charged for water damageMold

I haven't visited any properties, but they have responded to emails promptly, and they seem responsive, informed and I'd rent with them. I'm poor, disabled and have been rejected by many property owners simply for low income. Although my current landlord's happy with me. I'm educated and helpful.

This place is infested with bed bugs and roaches. Requested repairs have not been done. The gas stove was leaking so much gas that I had to call the fire dept. The fire dept. shut off the valve and even with all of that the stove was never repaired or replaced. There's a hole in the ceiling where the light fixture hangs, yes hangs. I've been there over 2 years the hole has never been repaired and there's bugs flying and crawling out of it. I had to get rid of a sofa I bought at furniture fair due to infestation of bed bugs. I also bought a brand new bed from furniture fair that is now also infested and still no extermination. They said they didn't receive my May rent. I told them it was mailed the 1st week of May. I proceeded to have the company I bought the money order from research to find the money order. Thiemann Realtor took me to court anyway. I showed my proof of purchase and proof of research for the money order to the courts. The Judge asked their representative if due to my proof if he would be willing to work it out, he said yes. Surprisingly I get a call from Thiemann's on May 31st stating they received the money order and stating I could stay in the unit. Then someone named Steve called and tried to get me to pay them some of their court cost. When I refused he used intimidation to try to get me to pay "THEIR" court cost to them. I immediately contacted Legal Aide and that's where I am with this company as of today 6/11/2018. I was told by legal representation that I did not have to pay "THEIR" court cost and that it was illegal for them to try to force me to send them money for their court cost. Oh and this "Steve" said he was going to have my things set out this Wednesday. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. This cheap apartment has already cost me over $800.00 in furniture and I'm sure over a $100.00 in bug sprays and alcohol.

I lived in Thiemann Property Apartment for 4 years and no problem until the last year where both buildings had a horrible outbreak of bed bugs. Which was not controlled and taken care of in a timely manner by management. I had to sit all of my furniture out after spending over $100 on pesticides then finally had to move.

Rent at your own risk (or at least learn from my mistakes).As others have said the management is extremely unprofessional. All communication is done though email. The phone number to call in case of an emergency is buried deep in 8 pages worth lease documentation.  When you do call with an issue, be prepared to leave a voicemail that may or may not be responded to in a timely manner. All face to face interaction is done through their maintenance worker. The hall and common areas were only cleaned when another apartment is going to be shown. When I moved in the apartment was not clean. The floors appeared clean until I mopped them and realized the tile was really about 2 shades lighter than I had originally thought. This didn’t really bother me until I received my security deposit back and over half of it was taken out for “cleaning” (I left the apartment cleaner than I had found it). I feel sorry for the poor sap who rented it before me who I am sure was hit with the same amount of ridiculous fees. The bottom line is insist on having a walk through when you move out (god forbid that the Klee’s actually have to step foot in their own building).  Or, at least take pictures of everything in the apartment when you move in and when you move out. I wish I would have been smarter and had hard evidence to fight them on the charges (but I don’t so it’s not really worth the headache of a “he said she said” fight). Hopefully this review is helpful to someone else.

Could find much better housing for the prices they charge you... All they care about is $$$. Very unprofessional when I would contact them, would often get short responses without answers to my inquiries. Two of the "upgrades" on the building I lived in actually downgraded the quality of service the tenants received. And again, as I have already stated, all they care about is money. Do NOT try to end your lease early, they will not work with you.

I strongly discourage anyone from renting from Kleemax. I feel like I got totally ripped off. I was hit with all kinds of fees when I moved out of the apartment, after I spent a good deal of time cleaning it and left it in better condition than when I received it! For example...$50 for cleaning the inside of cabinets?! There are only like 4 cabinets...and they were fine!Spend your money somewhere else.Cincinnati, OH.

Never rent from them. They will just increase your rent for no reason. Make false claims, and they over price their units.

I had to contact the police, BBB, and a lawyer after "Mike" the owner of DK Listings ripped me off. I took in a plasma TV that he offered to help me sell, it was worth close to $1,800...guess what he sold it for "$170". There is no way that is what he got for my TV. He said he would sell it on eBay but would not send the listing details. I found out there have been DOZENS of complaints to Fairfild PD over a 6 year period.  Apparently the scam is to take your item then sell it at the flea market and give you nothing for it.

This store is a ripoff- this guy isnt even a real ebay seller! I saw my own items sitting at a flea market booth his buddy runs a week later. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!

Mr. DK bent me over the table and plunged the meat bobber deep into my brown hole.  He pumped until my pockets were empty then tossed me out. I would suggest going here if you enjoy getting funked!!!!!!!

It s a shame that I am forced to leave this place a 1-star rating.  They deserve a no star rating!!!  These people are con artists who hide behind super fine print and super shady business practices, ripping CUSTOMERS off through the conduct of ILLEGAL activities.  There are NO good deals with these guys. I ll take you through a few of the fakes I ve picked up from them: Michael Jordan signed jersey with COA (COA from a company with a PO Box for an address and a the sig is no doubt a horrible fake),1979-80 O-Pee-Chee Wayne Gretzky Rookie card (Reprint-sold as being authentic).  These are just a few of the garbage items I ve picked up.  I m sure the tab will continue to pile up as I get things authenticated.  I m going to do everything I can to expose these dirt bags for who they really are: CROOKS.  Selling counterfeit goods is a criminal act, and I don t care how many disclaimers you throw up saying it is at the discretion of the buyer.  Bottom Line Up Front- YOUR COMPANY IS THE ONE SELLING FAKE STUFF!

This guy burned me harsh. I took him some of my video games to sell, like everyone else said I could't find them on eBay and they are not a real eBay drop center. He gave me like $30 for about $500 worth of PS3 games. I called the police on his gut, first thing and the police told me it was a civil matter. When I checked online I found the complaints of others and now I realize that I have been burned. The Fairfield police told me they get calls on this guy at least once a month.

This place is a great place to get ripped off if you have some free time! The Chud who owns the place claimed that he only got $93 out of a PS3 that was nearly new with 9 games. He robbed me really bad, I had close to a thousand dollars in that system and that was it. I live about 3 blocks from the place and I never see anyone in there now it is clear why no one is there and how this crook stays in business!DO NOT GO HERE YOU *********WILL*********** GET RIPPED OFF!!!

If I told my best friend about this place, I'd say this place is a joke. They burned me on some old elvis memrabillia. Also &quot;Mike&quot; the guy who runs the place smells weird and he has been waring the same clothes every time that I went in there I am starting to suspect he lives in the back.

I was looking online for some information on DK Listings because I took them some sports memrobilia and I got completely ripped off, I saw the other reviews for this dump and now I know exactly how I got hosed by these B*******. If your considering going here save your self some trouble, and just  find something else to do with your memrobilia, this place is a scam. They will jerk you around for weeks and then give you basicly nothing for the items that you take them.Also like the other user said they will not give you the url to the auction, because they are ripping you off. Also just like the other user said &quot;a guy came into the shop and bought my item&quot; BS I took it there to be sold on EBAY not given to there buddy for $12.Just list your item your self it takes about an hour to figure everything out, and it takes about 2 days to verify your PayPal account. You can do it at the Fairfield Library on there computers if you don't have your own Computer. It takes DK Listings 3 weeks to TRY to sell your item, and for them to rip you off. If you do it your self, worse case scenario you will have all of your money in your hand in 10 days. If you do a 3 day auction it will be 6 days. God Bless and Good Ridence to DK Listings.

This place is a huge scam, you should deffinitly never do business with them.Dk Listings is a scam that runs lke this.When the customer brings in there merchandise.The owners of the business never list it or purposely do a poor job of listing it.There friend &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;Bobby Farmer&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; buys your merchandise for a buck or two for his busines.Then they give you a pathetic ammount for your items.I took in roughly $800 worth of merchandise, and recieved a cool $35 backI also want to add that I know exactly how much this merchandise is worth on EBay, because I bought it in gross and had been successfully selling it on EBay myself for over a year.I only took the merchanidse to DK Listings because I was in the process of packing and moving. Yeah baby the big money, I called the owner and hetold me for over a month that he still had more to list blah, blah, blah.I eventualy called the fairifeld police department who went to question the owner of DK Listings who denied this ever happened.I also called the Better Business Bureu, and complainedAfter I complaned he told me he had no idea why I kept calling him and that he had already payed me.His story also changed as did his alaby &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;Bobby Farmer', who bought and resold my merchandise. It turns out that MIke from DK LIstings had cherry picked my items before selling it to him.I also checked on EBay for any trace of my items ever being listed there were none.Basicly they steal your merchandise, and sell it some where else through a flea market business. I have been ripped off three seperate times like this.If you wish to make money selling on EBay simply signup for a EBay account and PayPal account.!!! IT IS FREE !!!It's simple to do!EBay is user friendly and ANYONE can do it.Also DK LIstings is not an official EBAY drop center, I called EBAY and checked.IF you have had a similer issue plese contact the Fairfield Police Department, EBay, and the BBB, so we can collectively shut this scam down.Also the business license for DK Listings is for a car lot that they cal DK Automotive.I would suggest avoiding there car dealership as well because nothing is worse then buying a lemon.If you should have happened to have bought a bad car from them contact an attourney, you CAN sue them under THE CONSUMER SALES PRACTICE ACT.I purchased a car from AUTO KING which is only a few doors down from DK AUTOMOTIVE, and it was lemon.The Greasey owner IVAN told me I was screwed out of $4,750 for a broken Eclipse, I sued him for treble damages, attourney fees, etc. I won the case easily.Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!

Not so good. Actually the worst renting experience I have ever had. I left after my lease ended, and would never recommend. The landlord, Chad Osgood,  tried to keep most of my deposit but changed his mind when I provided a lengthy cell phone video of the premises upon my moving out. I work out of town so was hardly even there, I have no pets, I didn't even hang a single picture on the walls.  Renter Beware!!!  The building is the mackenzie building in mariemont, there are also a few other properties I understand. Also, the building smells funny, he said it was extermination fumes and it would go away, it did not.  Big thumbs down on this one.

I have worked with Jeremy through 2 tax seasons now. He handles our personal and business taxes. He is knowledgeable, dependable, and very responsive. He was the utmost professional and answered every question that I had. Jeremy took the time to explain things that I did not understand with our business taxes and was very easy to work with. His fees are also reasonable, which is hard to find with someone so knowledgeable!

Jeremy is great — I'm working with him to file multiple years of back taxes and handle remediation with the IRS. Because he's a licensed CPA, I have a lot of confidence in his abilities to help me get things sorted out with the IRS. He's also easy to work with and his fees are really reasonable. I found out about him through his ads on WRR radio, and I'm glad I called him.

Hands down this is the best law firm that I've used. Ms. Mathis and Mr. Carpenter was very helpful throughout the entire case. I mainly was assisted by Ms. Mathis and she was great. Any time I had a question or concern she gave me a clear explanation. Response times were phenomenal. I've never had to sit and wonder if they received my email message or phone call. I'm  still amazed at the service and outcome of my case. I know 5 stars are the max that you can rate  a company but they truly deserve 10+ stars. Thank you again for providing excellent service. I will definitely refer any of my friends/family that's in need of legal assistance to your firm. Continue the great work and I hope you all continue to thrive.

First I would like to say that I am completely at fault for falling so far in my back-taxes. I was w-2 then 11 years ago switched to 1099. Needless to say, I couldnt afford my taxes due. I waited and waited but was never able to catch up. One day I was hit with a bank levy and wage garnishment. I called Anderson Bradshaw Conusltants because enough was enough. They stopped the garnishment within two days. It took longer(of course) to completely fix my tax mess, but they did. Completely honest and worth it. definite recommend!!

I am a truck driver and have been for 25 years. For the past 10 years I went without filing my taxes. I have back taxes, a levy, A bank Levy, And my wages were about to be garnished. I called Anderson Bradshaw consultants and within seven hours they stopped my bank levy. And released my wage garnishment. I am on the road to being settled with the IRS and state taxes. Also, I can go back to work without any worry.

I didn't get what I thought I would get when I paid for my daughter's tax case to be handled by this group. She ended up paying as much as she would if we had just done it ourselves. I should have just kept the $3000 I spent with them. Didn't meet expectations they set up front. Not a good experience.

I was a bit nervous at first trusting a company I found online to help me with taxes, but John immediately put me at ease. I owed over $75,000 to the IRS and had a number of missing tax returns and the IRS had already put a wage garnishment on my pay and had just hit my bank account for a sizable chunk of change. Within 24 hours of signing up John put me in touch with an ABC Attorney who got me my money back from the IRS and stopped the wage garnishment. I was kept informed throughout the process and every step was explained to me to make sure I knew what was happening. At the end, I only ended up having to pay the IRS $2,500. I cannot recommend Anderson Bradshaw enough.

I came to Anderson Bradshaw with a $36,000 tax liability. After speaking with Mr. King, he put me in good hands with Josh Kronick. He immediately protected me from IRS Collection action, informed me every step of the way for what to expect from the process, and ultimately delivered me an Offer-in-Compromise that settled my tax burden for $500. I cannot recommend this firm enough. They gave me a fresh lease on life. Thank you!

When we received a letter from the IRS saying my daughter owed them over $18,000 for income in 2013, we nearly had heart attacks! Her U.S. income in that year was only around $5,000, because that was the year she started teaching in Asia. Calls to the IRS gleaned only a little information, but it appeared that an ex of hers had accessed her PayPal account, sold his products online, but not forwarded the information to her nor did he tell her about it. I found Anderson Bradshaw online, contacted them, and after working with Josh and Ted for a short period, they managed to get it all cleared up and proper paperwork filed to clear her of all liabilities. We could not have done it without their help, and I will be eternally appreciative.

I am a United States Navy Veteran, who recently found himself in hot water with IRS . They wanted all these old returns and W-2' s that I haven't seen in years . I called around for help but the tax preparers could only go back 2 years. The other tax firms wouldn't return my call. It was only when I contacted Anderson Bradshaw and spoke to Ted England that I was finally able to get the help that I needed. I am not some rich guy or some huge company ; however, Ted was willing to take the time to get my issue resolved. Thanks to Anderson Bradshaw Tax Consultants I am finally able to get my life back from the IRS.

I was paying the IRS $400 a month for 2 years and I was getting NO WHERE!  When I initially set it up I didn't realize how much they charged for penalties and interest.  It's down right criminal (but that's whole different story) Last summer, things got pretty tough for my wife and I, we were robbing Peter to pay Paul and we just couldn't keep up with the payment any longer.  I had spoke with a few companies a couple years back when all of this started, but they didn't seem like they could offer too much help.  Thankfully I found Anderson Bradshaw through YP and I'm really happy that I did!  I spoke with Ted, he was very patient and answered all of my questions through out the consultation. He explained our options and mapped out a step by step outline of how they were going to resolve our case. There's finally a light at the end of the tunnel for us and they saved us quite a bit of money in the end.  Thank so much for ending this nightmare & getting us that Fresh Start you promised

When I began my search for a tax attorney, it was my understanding  "serve this area" would have been completed in the state I resided.  My paperwork made it across the country from Los Angeles, California to Baltimore, Maryland.  The same paperwork had to be submitted twice, one for each office.   I would have felt more comfortable if the paperwork could have been handled once.   I know that I would have felt more confident  if I could have worked with the same person the whole way through the process.

I cannot recommend ANDERSON BRADSHAW highly enough. There is always a courteous person to answer my questions and I personally work with Bill Davis most all the time. He has dealt with all my inept questions and queries. My account is not completely settled but is moving right along and the results are definitely are meeting my approval! My husband and I had ourselves in a real mess and they are getting things worked out really well. If you have any doubts about this company...don't hesitate to HIRE THEM ASAP!

I'm happy to write this review. I called ABC Tax two months ago when the IRS put a lien on my home and levied my wages. I was in $85,000 in debt to the IRS from when I started my own business many years ago. I never made any money in that business and now the IRS is threatening to take everything I have. As soon as I was transferred to Jeff, he put my mind at ease.  He is very knowledgable about tax help and tax resolution. He told me that he can stop the levy that day. and that I could settle my tax bill for only 5k. You guys did what you promised and now that I am paying back my reduced amount, The irs is removing the lien on my home and now I have a fresh start.

My wife works as independent contractor and we got careless about quarterly deposits so after about 2 years we owed way too much. We looked around and this guy calmed us down and was able to get us some kind of compromise with the IRS  and payments that we can now afford. yes, we recommend them.

A tax preparer whom I have worked with for years turned out to be stealing from me. Michelle Moya Pearl stole my stimulus money, opened fraudulent accounts using my identity, and screwed me on my latest tax return when I began connecting the dots. Absolutely scandalous, this company is well aware of her wrong doings. Don't trust these people with your information or money.

Being legally bound to financial jargons all my life, I faced some tax evasion issues last year where I was going to be rendered superfluous by the court if they had acquitted me.

Keith is a highly skilled technician. In addition to repairing a toilet, I appreciated his evaluation of possible future problems from old emergency cut off valves, a 12 year old water heater & a leaking kitchen sink side sprayer complete with a written estimate for each repair. I definitely plan to continue to do business with C & W Plumbing.

C&W HAS HONEST, KNOWLEDGEABLE PLUMBERS!Rod took one look at my yard and determined that my high water bills were probably due to a broken sprinkler head (my system runs late at night, so I had not noticed.  We tested the system and confirmed this.  I told him I could fix this, and he said there would be no charge for this visit.This is the second time I have had a C&W plumber out to my house (for different issues), and both times I have been very impressed with their knowledge and INTEGRITY.  They will be my plumbers from now on.Jeff StubingLewisville

David L. from Herndon McFarland Plumbing went above and beyond to take care of customers. I had a leaking water concern after the 2021 winter storm, and he came in to help me detect the issue. He is very knowledgeable, professional, and considerate. With his over 25 years of working experience, he helped me troubleshoot the issue and identify the problems. David L. is incredible.I highly recommended Herndon McFarland Plumbing.

Mr. Bruce is a craftsman. I was impressed for all the obvious reasons, prompt, professional, experienced and reasonably priced. But beyond that, his demeanor and workmanlike attitude and enthusiasm for doing a job right have me sold on him as my go to provider from now on.

Bruce is professional, on time, and very knowledgeable about his job. If you call his number, leave a voicemail and he will call you back ASAP. He arrived on time and his price is very affordable and reasonable. As a lady who doesn't know anything about our house and plumbing, he also taught me stuff that should be done in our drain that would be helpful in the future. I hope I don't need his service again but if we have drain sewer problem, Bruce is the only person I will call again! Thank you Bruce!

Bruce answered my call on Janurary 1,2013 and came out immediately. He found my problem within 30 minutes. It was a city drain problem. The city corrected it within 24 hours. Bruce"s charge was very reasonable, Another plumber had spent 10 hours and did not find the problem, however he charged a tremendeous afterhours fee..
 - 
 -

 - 
We've been using Bruce now for several years and he is extremely reliable and very trustworthy.  Bruce will give you a narrow window of time that he will arrive, and he always arrives promptly at the beginning of that time slot.  So I like that I don't have to wait around for someone.  His prices are very reasonable, and on this last trip he was able to troubleshoot a problem I had in the sewer line. It was something that he did not have the equipment to take care of, but he gave me good advise on what to consider in finding a reputable company that could handle it.  You can't go wrong with Bruce's Sewer & Drain Cleaning.

Awesome company.  I will never use another company for my AC and Heating needs.  I had a unit installed about a year ago.  The salesman, installers, and service men were courteous and knowledgeable.

I am new to working with Quigley Heating and Air.  They have been to the house on two occasions for two different units.  Both times they have found the issue that another local A/C company did not find.  They made repairs and we haven't had any additional issues.  I look forward to working with Quigley's on my A/C & Heating issues in the future and recommend them and their crews.

I have used Quigley for over 15 years now after getting ripped off by miscellaneous Heating/AC companies throughout the years.  What a relief to know that if I have a problem I have a company to call who will give me an honest answer and try to cost me the least amount of money. They even have an annual service deal that gives a discount on any work needed.  I had a house built in the late seventies that had all sorts of problems.  The Quigley guys never tried to get me to replace it like some companies and just worked on the existing system to get it running. Their employees are experienced, personable and thorough, and dont rush a job like some other will do. I think one of the greatest challenges as a homeowner is finding reasonable, honest companies to get different work done, plumbers, electricians, maintenance, and heating and air. I would recommend Quigley without question to any friend with total confidence.

Key provides fast and friendly service.  It was Friday after 5pm and I called a few plumbers who took hours before getting back to me.  On getting to this one, there was a live plumber on the phone who beat out the rest.  I gave him a brief history of my issue (I was installing a water hammer arrestor on an old leaky valve)  and he came in and took a look at the pipes.  He knew immediately what needed to be done and got working.  He even explained a few things.

Today at 1:00 AM, my restroom sink exploded in my face sending HOT water everywhere.  I didn't know what to do so I tried fixing it the best way I know how and I got it to stop, but it was now leaking horribly.  Around 3:00 AM I gave up.  Meanwhile my wife called plenty of 24 hr plumbers and Bobby Key from 24 Plumbing Inc.  just left and it is 4:30 AM and he had to do alot of work, plus he actually explained to me what he was doing cause I hate not knowing and he was patient, kind, extremely FAST and efficient.  He fixed the problem, did some extra work and had the absolutely lowest rate from ALL other 24 hr plumbers.  Thank God because my daughter's 1 yr old B-Day party is today at 2:00 PM and we have tons to still do and with that leak in the ONLY bathroom would have halted the planned invitation only party we have planned since she was born and Bobby was able to save the party now to clean all that water in the restroom!  :)

We have used Speakes Plumbing personally and have also recommended them to our customers through our company when needed and cannot say enough good things about this company. Our customers feedback have always been great as well. Very courteous, professional, knowledgeable and extremely reasonable!  All the things one should look for in a company!  Highly recommend!!

I had a great experience with Speake’s Plumbing.  When I first called and explained my problem, I was given an estimate of the cost – which was $100 less than another estimate I already had.  Once the plumber arrived, a very nice and polite gentleman, he figured that the problem was easier to solve and less expensive than the 1st estimate.  I found this very honest as they could have charged me the amount that they had already given me.  I would recommend Speake’s Plumbing!

Accurate Leak did a repair of our plumbing after a foundation lift exposed multiple leaks.Six months later a leak was detected in the kitchen area. Accurate Leak sent out a very competent and professional technician who spent 8 hours to remove the brick, make the repair and replace all the masonry like new!I would strongly recommend Accurate Leak to any homeowner looking for a reputable plumbing company that stands behind its company's warranty!Howard & Janell P

This is the truth. This is the best money I have every spent. No jack hammering a slab, no stone floor repaired, no wood floors destroyed no digging no trench. These people are really pros. They are not cheap but as daddy said "you get what you pay for" and I did not want to tear up my house to fix the two separate leaks in my sewer. So I shopped for a better way and thank the Lord I really did find it with this company. If you are worried about a jack hammer going into your floor and then the foundation, then the dirt being hauled out and then back in, and the dust and mess, this is positively the answer.  If I could give them 10 stars I would do it.  I am so pleased. I am so pleased with this results that don't mind giving anyone in this situation my personal account of the facts, just call me (John)  at 469-261-6000 and I will give you the blow by blow of what the company did for me; the cost, the time, and the expertise they used, the results.

Unhappy Irving Resident.  I thought Irving Cares would help once I was in a financial crisis but I was wrong.  I pleaded for help with rental assistance but becasue I did not live in an apartment complex I was told I could not recieve any help.  They told me the home owner, my landlord, would have to file for help...does that make any sense?  To top it all off the person I was speaking with hung up the phone when I began to cry....sounds really caring, doesn't it?

This is place you need to go to get emergency help. I was first worried that they would not help me because I had a job. That was not the case, we all run into a wall from time to time and cant crawl out. They are all so sweet and willing to do anything to help. They paid my txu bill for two months which was aroung $800.00 and they paid for my daycare for two weeks for me. They gave me food and even diapers for my baby. They are all heaven sent. They won't make you feel bad they will make you feel better. Mary is so wonderful to work with and understanding. GOD bless you Mary!

Although this number is thus far useless as to speaking to anyone; the correct one is:  (214) 760 4526 Unfortunately I was given the brushoff by a very condescending USPS Consumer Affairs rep and am forced to do my own research to locate a lost certified letter. Still searching... I'll update if I find a better contact.

This is not DFW main post office  number

This is NOT the telephone number for the Dallas Post Office.  This is the national 800 number the USPS where you can't get anything other than canned messages.  If you DO manage to get past all the prompts, you're put on hold and that's it.  I never did get through to a person, not that it would have mattered since it's just a generic office for generic answers to generic questions.  I can't find a working number for this office, nor can anyone at any other Dallas Post Office give me a number for this location.  I find this to be an embarrassment.  I don't work for the post office, but I am a federal employee.  When I take a call, I try very hard to either give the individual the information they need, or put them through to someone who can.  And if someone needs the number for another office, I do my best to get that number for them.  To all tax payers out there, I am ashamed of other federal agencies who behave this way, and I offer my apologies for their shameful behavior.  Some of us do actually care.

The telephone number is no good and the hours of operation are wrong.  Why is it that most government services (Service is a joke here) could care less about public relations?  Is the postmaster here too lazy to take a 2 minute break and give the American public correct information?  At the very least, he could have one of the employees do it.  Don't play the short-handed card with me.  There are ample employees at every location.  Note how slow they all move.

It's a though you all don't want any business. Where's the customer service?  You can't talk to anyone, you can't get question asked or resolved: this is a mess. If the Postal Service goes out of business, it's your own fault because you seem to have forgotten the main purpose of your survival.  SERVICE!!!!!!  What company that wants to remain viable, wouldn't update their phone #.

I called to ask how long I had to get my car out and was on hold for 45 minutes and noone ever picked up. Well my dad was at the Impound when I was calling and said noone was even answering the phones. And when it was finally his number the lady was extremely rude and no help at all. Because we had just picked up the car and didn't know the license plate or vin number then got pulled over at 11 pm on the 22 so we were not sure if it was the 22nd or 23rd. Well she told him to "come back when you have more information! Next!" Ridiculous! Couldn't she have looked it up by his name or something?  How do we get more information when they dont answer the phones?

Fui gravemente herido en un accidente de construcción, y busqué la ayuda del bufete de abogados de Ryan Thompson como mis abogados de lesiones laborales. Una persona que operaba una grúa de construcción estaba trabajando conmigo cuando sufrí mis lesiones por accidentes de trabajo. La carga de la grúa me golpeó en la espalda y me caí del piso en el que estaba trabajando y caí más de 20 pies. Nadie me entrenó para asegurar mi arnés de seguridad, y no lo estaba asegurando correctamente al edificio. Sufrí una lesión cerebral traumática, me fracturé la pierna izquierda y me fracturé el brazo izquierdo. La empresa de construcción que era no tenía seguro de compensación para trabajadores y no sabía qué hacer para mis lesiones por accidentes de trabajo. El abogado de accidentes de construcción que utilicé en el bufete de abogados de lesiones de Ryan Thompson sabía cómo lidiar con mis lesiones laborales, mi empleador y la compañía de seguros del propietario del edificio. Ryan El León, me ayudó a conseguir un gran acuerdo, y estoy muy satisfecho con los servicios legales que recibí sin pagar nada por adelantado con el bufete de abogados.#Expert#Very Professional

Thank God I hired Richard McConathy. Not only did he clean up my record, but he got my life back on the right track. I am recently divorced and my whole life just exploded into a mess of my own making. I am shocked that I wasn't thrown in jail with how many times I went in front of the judge. Yet Richard kept saving me. Finally he gave me the big talk and I'll tell you that it was a big wake up. I'm now back on track in life. Richard is a great lawyer and wise beyond his years, but most important is he cares what happens to you as a person. You can trust this man with your life, I did.

Richard saved my life from the path of destruction it was on. My twenties was full of many hazy memories and mistakes. I should be in prison for my selfishness, but because of one man and my sweet Gama I doing life right. So many other lawyers would have quit on me, but Richard kept going. He kept me out of prison and got me into treatment and kept it where I could seal my record. I'm now married to the love of my life with two of the most precious little girls a man could wish for. I just got my master plumber standing and own my own business. This wouldn't be happening If one man, Richard McConathy, didn't save me. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

Got the first and last DWI of my life. I was so overwhelmed and did't know where to start. The entire system is designed to confuse the average person to the benefit of the State. I found Richard online and watched his videos. I felt very at ease with how he said he would handle my case after meeting in person. From start to finish the firms handling of my case was outstanding. If your in need of DWI defense in North Texas call Richard McConathy first.

Richard and Brian are some really good lawyers in my book. They took what looked like to me as an impossible situation and somehow got it to turned in my favor.

As a local business owner, I could not have a conviction on my record. This would have ruined my reputation and my ability to make an income. I felt after interviewing Richard that he really understood my issues and needs unlike the other attorneys I saw prior to him. I am glad I made the right choice, my case was dismissed! In addition to his top notch legal work, I found the way he and his office work together as a team is five star all the way. This law firm says they strive to be the best and their work ethic shows it. I know how hard it is to find good people and Richard has assembled a great team. Much thanks to Cynthia.

You never think your going to be arrested in your life. You go to school, get a good job and work hard. Then someone you thought cared for you points the finger and said you did something to get back at you. No one listened, especially the police and DA. That all changed after I hired Richard McConathy. He took over the case and he and his team of lawyer fought back and won. Not only did he fight hard, but he treated me like a person and not a number. This guy takes pride in what he does and cares about you as a client, but more importantly as a person.

I cannot give enough praise to Richard and the whole staff that worked on my case. From the start Richard was very professional and took charge on my case. This is a larger criminal defense firm with about 6 lawyers. I was afraid i wouldn't get the personal touch but that was not the case. Every time I called I received a return call that day. Felt at ease and in good hands, especially with Richards paralegal Cynthia. This legal team has the man power to take on bigger cases like mine and I am happy I hired them. Thanks to everyone for there hard work.

Thanks to Richard I have a clean record! Only been in trouble in my life two times. Once, right out of collage and and 40 years later after I got pulled over last year. In both cases I used a McConathy as my lawyer. I used Richard's father- Tex back in the 70's and now the son. I have to say that tough lawyers run in this families blood. Thanks again Richard for all your hard work.

Words are not enough to express my thanks to Richard McConathy and his team. His efforts alone saved my daughter. At the start of it all, things seemed so hopeless for us, but after hiring Richard that all changed. Although it was a draw out process, Richard assured us that things would break our way eventually. One of the best decisions in my life was choosing him as my daughter's lawyer! Great Job Richard!

Wow, Wow, Wow! Richard McConathy is the best criminal defense lawyer in DFW. I was being charged for defending myself from my EX and it got filed as a felony. My sweet Dad told me to use his friend as my lawyer. This lawyer was very nice man but as the case went on I started to see he wasn't familiar with criminal law. I was set for trial and I was in a total panic. I found Richard and he agreed to take over the case with only two week to get ready. After looking at the file for ten minutes he found an error in my EX's statement and used it in court. The judge agreed and the case was dismissed and I got a ticket. From a felony facing up to 10 years to a 50.00 dollar ticket Wow! Only hire real criminal defense attorney. Richard McConathy is the best.

I am very happy I found this firm to handle my case. I made a big mistake coming home from Denver with a few items that were legal in that State, but quickly learned by Texas highway patrol it was not here. It's a felony! My friend got charged with the same case as well. He went with a lawyer friend of his family that does civil law. I wanted a criminal lawyer. What a big difference in how the cases were handled. My case was knocked down to a class C and just had the case erased off my record. My friend took 3 years of felony probation and we were in the same car. Great work by Richard and the whole team up at the office.

Cannot say enough good things about Richard and Brian. From start to finish my case was handled with care and professionalism. They always took the time to make sure I knew what was going on in my case. At the start things looked very bad from a evidence standpoint, but Richard told me to give it time and allow his team to sort it out. I couldn't be happier with the results. Thanks to all including the staff of paralegals, great job!

As a single mother, money can be very tight and life overly stressful. I got myself into a bad situation thinking I could make some easy money with a friend. Was I wrong! I was so stupid in not realizing I was really looking at some jail time. I sat up most nights after my arrests thinking who was going to take care of my kids if I was sent away for a long time. Thank God I found Richard McConathy. He took my case with a great payment plan I could afford and was always on myside in the case and with my money issues. After it was all done I never spent a day in jail and I was never convicted of a felony. I've got a new lease on life thanks to him. If your like me and your kids are all you got and need help, Richard is the lawyer you need.

Having a good time a Jerry World and was heading home after the game. As usual the Arlington PD was out in full force. Cops stopped me and wouldn't even give me a reason why. 18 hrs later after taking my blood by force I got out of jail. I got right on my phone and the first guy to pop up was Richard McConathy. Within 5 minutes I was on the phone with him. Wow, what a take charge type of lawyer. You can tell he runs a tight ship because everything from his staff down to his associates are top notch. After watching my tape he and his team in Fort Worth argued to the judge the stop was not legal and the Judge agreed. My case was dismissed and I'm getting it erased off my record. Would Highly recommend Richard!

Richard McConathy and his team of lawyers are the Best in Texas! I really messed up and was going to lose everything including going to Prison!!! I don"t know who they did it, but the whole case is gone. Poof like magic. It took almost a year, and Richard kept telling me to be patient. He was right all along. Big thanks to Brian, Cythina, Amanda, Joylyin, and the whole team. I can never repay you fully for what you guys have done for me.

I went to a show at Winstar and was caught coming back down to Dallas in Denton. The cop said I was speeding, but I knew he was lying. I spent about over 1000.00 dollars getting me and my car out of jail. What a freaking racket. I was real apprehensive finding a honest lawyer. I interviewed about 20 of them and found most of them to be the same guy or gal in a suit until I found Richard. This guy is the real deal. Was very impressed with his knowledge of the law and his  local connections. He and Brian took my case to trial and got a not guilty. If your in the same situation I was in, don't mess with the local traffic ticket lawyers, get a great dwi lawyer like Richard and Brian!

To say I was behind the 8 Ball was an understatement, I got myself into trouble again and this time the court was out for blood. If the DA had got their way I would be in jail for 180 days and would have lost my job and home. Hired Richard in hopes of just getting it somewhat under control. Wow was I surprised with the results. 3 days time served. I walked out with him and Brian and no longer have to deal with Tarrant county anymore. Thanks guys, I'm now on the right path.

Who do you call when you have a 0.131 BAC in a DWI arrest? That’s right! Better call Warren. Working with Mr. Warren Abrams, Joshua and their team are a relief to work with. It is next to impossible to win a case such as mine especially in COLLIN COUNTY with a blood test score of 0.131. But Warren and his team won my DWI jury trial with a blood test. I am an immigrant and it was very unfortunate for me to land in this situation and it is very difficult to deal with DWI as an immigrant. Warren was very patient in hearing me out and suggested me to work with an immigration attorney while he worked on the DWI case. That was reassuring for me in a sense that all my problems were being taken care of. It is such a relief for me now that we won the case and the nightmare had ended. He still working with me now even after the case to get my charge expunged. I now, do not have to pay court fees, take probation and any other fines. All thanks to Warren, Joshua, Rose, and Rhea. Thank you everyone of you for supporting me all along.

Let me start by saying that Warren Abrams is hands down THE BEST defense attorney in Dallas.  Don't be fooled by other lawyers with their catchy gimmicks and crazy commercials.  Mr. Abrams is the real deal.  When he says that he will fight for you, he means it.  He, and his son Joshua Abrams, successfully defended me against my DWI arrest which resulted in my case being COMPLETELY DISMISSED!!  I couldn't be happier with the outcome and I have Warren and Joshua to thank for that.  Take it from me, If you have legal troubles you're going to want these two heavy hitters in the courtroom with you.  Their hard work and perseverance throughout the entire length of my case was what put me at ease.  I'm going to tell everyone who will listen that justice prevailed, and that they were the law firm that made it happen.  With that being said, I sincerely thank you Mr. Abrams along with your entire legal team.  Keep up the great work!!

Warren Abrams was a life saver. He is extremely professional and knows the court system. He was able to plead my DWI charge down to an obstruction of justice charge. He was not only personal, caring, and kind, but experienced and knowledgeable in navigating this difficult case.

When my wife (now ex-wife) filed false allegations against me during our ongoing divorce case, Mr. Abrams went above and beyond to prove my innocence. Due to Mr. Abrams extensive knowledge of the legal system, he was able to prove my innocence to the assistant district attorney without ever going to trial. Mr. Abrams' swift actions resulted in my case being dismissed in the interest of justice. Mr. Abrams and his staff carefully listened to all my concerns and addressed every question in a timely manner. I highly recommend Mr. Abrams to anyone needing legal counsel.

Anything I write here would not do Warren Abrams justice for what he offers to a client.  He knows everyone in the court system.  He has been on the other side.  He has compassion.  I had questions during off hours and Mr. Abrams and his staff were available to me.  I felt like they were willing to put their lives on hold to bring me the peace and comfort that I needed, at the times that I needed it.  On top of that, Mr. Abrams used his abilities to somehow keep me out of jail, even though jail time was a requirement in my case.  Finally, Mr. Abrams was successful in resolving my case in a way that I thought was completely impossible.  He is a miracle worker. Mr. Abrams truly gave me my life back.

Warren Abrams is focused, has impeccable work ethic and gets desired results and more.  I used his services on multiple occasions over the last 20 years.  He never once let me down.  His client's best interest always comes first, and he has proven that consistently in all my cases.  I have referred hm multiple times without hesitation.  although my personal decisions required an attorney, Mr. Abrams worked "miracles" in my book with the least amount of pain.  He knows what he is doing, he doesn't settle for mediocre results and he is straight forward.  Don't be surprised if he takes your "well-being" to heart.  He offers helpful resources,  calls outside of office hours and takes a genuine interest in any "recovery" you might be involved in.  On multiple occasions I could have had "jail time".  On all those occasions, I didn't.

The law offices of Warren Abram are the best legal representation one could ever ask for. From the first day, I walked into their office, I knew that they had my best interests at heart and my case would be handled with a sincere personal touch. I felt like I was among family. The office staff, Rhea and Rose were very personable yet professional and kept me informed about where in the process my case was and advised me accordingly on what the next step was. My attorney, Mr. Abram is an outstanding lawyer and an absolute asset to have on your side. Even before taking on my case, he listened intently, was extremely compassionate and very thorough in explaining to me what we would be facing and what needed to be done to achieve a positive outcome. He is very knowledgeable of the court system and always seemed to be steps ahead and able to foresee any curve ball that was thrown at us. All throughout my case he was always available to answer my questions and especially very prompt at returning my calls. He was also very comforting and quick to alleviate my worries when I would panic. He is also very understanding of the financial burden of legal representation and willing to let me pay him in installments which most other attorneys would not let you do. His preparation was extremely detailed and he was relentless in his pursuit for a positive verdict. He fought for me and won my case and I am forever thankful for his dedication and expertise. At the end, I felt he was like a father to me, trying to protect me and my career. One needs to look no further for representation as he is an amazing attorney.

Outstanding resolution of my case. I trusted him with my life and he didn't disappoint. Great lawyer. An even better person with decades of experience. Helped me manage my nerves while breaking down the government's case like it was a house of cards; piece by piece. Warren will definitely stay on my speed dial!

One of the most honest and helpful attorneys.  I had a serious felony offense.  He took my problems and made them his priority.  Warren Abrams without a doubt helped me turn my life around.  He gave me my life back.  I would highly recommend him over any attorney in Dallas. To anyone that is going through something that seems impossible to beat, Warren Abrams is the attorney to call.  Thank you Warren!

Mr. Abrams decades of experience as a trial attorney is unmistakable and resulted in the best outcome possible for my case. I have had charges pending against me for driving while intoxicated in Collin County for nearly two years. Warren was able to alleviate the massive amounts of stress I dealt with in what seemed like a never ending tug of war with the courts. I was treated like a son at every step, he was always honest and never made any guarantees like any decent lawyer should. He went out of his way to visit the site of my arrest with me on a weekend before we were set for trial. We had countless meetings and his staff was extremely friendly and accommodating to my busy schedule. When we finally made it to court for the last time Warren was relentless and showed me the value of his trial experience and long time professional relationships with the Judge and Prosecutors alike.

You will not find a more knowledgeable or more honest defense attorney than Warren Abrams. I have used Mr. Abrams on a few occasions in situations regarding my son.  He knows the law and was straight with us about what he could do for us. He explored every strategy that could be used. He and his entire staff showed us kindness and compassion - which was pretty unexpected and very appreciated! Mr. Abrams always returned our calls and answered all our questions. I give Mr. Abrams my highest recommendation.

Mr. Abrams is a fantastic attorney. I was arrested for a DWI and given a field sobriety test. I hired Mr. Abrams as I read that he was the best. The DA took a while to process the case, and scheduled a trial. Mr. Abrams was able to get the case dismissed on a motion to suppress, and all charges were dropped. He was very helpful and knowledgeable throughout the process and I was able to rest easy knowing everything was in good hands. Very highly recommended!

I was facing multiple felonies all carrying a heavy penalty so I called Warren Abrams at the advice of a friend. I was told he was the best and that he was the defense I needed... well known, well networked, fierce and effective. So I hired him. With Mr. Abrams help, the DA's investigation ended and all charges were dropped. Mr. Abrams continually went above and beyond for me and his staff was always extremely helpful. I highly recommended him!

Mr. Abrams worked a miracle and won my breath test trial!!!  I was arrested for DWI, given all field sobriety tests, and a breath test. I looked really good on video, but I blew a .14.  Mr. Abrams was the 3rd attorney I interviewed based on a friend's referral, and I immediately knew he was the one!  He was so knowledgeable, made me feel at ease and calmed my nerves, and gave me confidence there was a chance to beat this thing, especially because of my video.  We proceeded to trial, he was so amazing in court, very knowledgeable and impressive, and really fought for me. Mr. Abrams pulled a rabbit out a hat at the last minute and proposed non probable cause for arrest, in which no evidence after such arrest would be admissible.  Well low and behold the jury came back and agreed... NOT GUILTY!   You ROCK Warren!!!!  Not to mention your staff is awesome!!!  So helpful, caring, comforting, and reassuring!

I am a young man that was accused of a DWI 2nd. Using Mr. Abrams in the past I knew that I needed the best of the best. We took my case to court and won. I am completely and utterly satisfied with Mr. Abrams and his staff. There was no charge for fax or phone calls at any point, Just one low flat charge that I was able to make payments on. I am ecstatic to consider Mr. Abrams my only and family attorney. I do and will be continuing to use Mr. Abrams for any and all legal issues in the future. With how reasonably priced, And the Level of professionalism of Mr. Abrams and his staff I recommend him to anyone.

Mr. Warren Abrams is an unbelievable lawyer.  I was charged with a DWI after blowing a .12 and consulted several lawyers before ultimately choosing Mr. Abrams.  The first time I walked into his office all of my stress immediately subdued.  He assured me everything was going to work out, and work out it did! Mr. Abrams got all of my charges dropped within the first 8 months!!  The case never even made it to court, it was dropped at the preliminary hearing.  Not only was Mr. Abrams a brilliant lawyer but he and his office were parent figures as well.  They would check up on me weekly just to make sure everything was going smoothly.  I can not say enough good words about Mr. Abrams, he is truly a professional.  I recommend him to anyone that gets a DWI/DUI charge.

Let me just say that I have no words to express the gratitude my family and I have for Mr. Abrams. My Fiancé had a ridiculous case agst him, but due to him having prior convictions, we were really worried about it! Warren spent over 18 months working on it. He took the time to explain everything to me and advise me of exactly how to handle the situation. His office (Rose & Rhea) would even call just to check on me and my girls and reassure us through this horrible time. That said a lot about their character! We were treated as people, not just another dollar sign. (After the case was over, he requested an invite to the wedding, which he'll get, but that just shows how genuine he truly is!! As for the case, he was able to get My Fiancé 18 mths from 15 yrs!! I am so thankful for everything he and his staff have done and will recommend him to everyone I know!

Roy Kevin Petty was and remains the reason I am able to live my life fully as a mother and a single one at that. My marriage was difficult and the details were painful. My parents brought me illegally to this country when I was a baby and left me with my aunt. I was arrested and ice took me and Roy convinced the lieutenant to release me. Roy kept me grounded, focused and determined as a human being, which gave me the confidence boost I needed to move on. This confidence is why I am the best mother possible. I am thankful and grateful to him because my ex tried to have me deported. I am in a good place to parent my child, which never would have happened with another lawyer.   He made the experience that much more human. I will always refer him to others.

We urgently required a professional lawyer to help us with our investor visas as they are all expiring. We are grateful to have found Mr. Petty; with his knowledge and wisdom of this area, he negotiated our investor visas with excellent results. Mr Petty made changes to our subsidiary in Florida and reapplied the visas for us. Each one of us is thankful for his amazing pull off as we approached him in the eleventh hour and yet he managed to secure the interviews fast. At the embassy appointment, our visas got approved. Thank you Mr Petty for going the extra mile and burning midnight oil just to help us with this matter. Highly Recommended lawyer, professional and sincere with helping us; he took time to explain and answer all our questions. Thank you again!

He is an excellent and professional lawyer who does the best for his clients. He does not help his clients because it is his job, but because it is his passion to help others. He helped my mom stay here legally 6 years ago and did her citizenship last year. He did an amazing, professional, and ethical job.  I highly recommend him,  He is an amazing lawyer.

Immigration is screwedup. illegals come in all the time and my wife was deported to Ireland--yes Ireland because we were sick of waiting for the lazy immigration agents to process her paperwork. the agent at the airport deported her for 5 years. I found Petty through a coworker. He may 2 phone calls and got the deportation taken back. In two weeks she was back in the US and had our baby 2 months later.

Encontré el Sr. Roy Petty después de conducir una investigación. Yo habia utilizado varios abogados de inmigración en el... pasado. Esta vez, necesitaba un super abogado porque USCIS negó mi solicitud de naturalización y comenzó los procedimientos de deportación. Fue muy directo desde el principio. Larga historia corta, el Sr. Petty cambio la decision de inmigración y ahora soy un ciudadano de los EE.UU.. Si bien eufórico, me sorprendió también en el resultado debido a la forma USCIS presento los problemas a mí. Es un abogado raro que puede reverser los decisiones. Él salvó mi carrera y mi familia.

My husband and me talked with 4 lawyers that I couldn t fix his papers cuz he was deported several times. Mr Pety told us there was a way to get him a a permission to work and that in a few years he could get citizenship.I went back to one of the lawyers who has a big law firm and told him what Pety said cuz i wasnt sure since so many lawyers told me nothing could be done. that lawyer said Pety was a good lawyer so i went back to him.he got the permission and a driver license. i hope in a few years he can get his citizenship.

What impressed me most is that they work fast. I met with Vicky on a Saturday and she filed by Dream Act application on Monday. I got my legal permit in less than 3 months. Then I got a green card through my wife. I did a provisional waiver and went to Honduras for 4 days and came back with a green card. I did everything in less than 5 months and was out for a lot less than what attorney Petty told me. Thank you I will refer all my friends to you.

I found that I had a disease called "Schlerodema" and was no longer able to work.  I was afraid that I would not be able to take care of my family if I wasn't able to continue working.I applied with Social Security for disability by myself and was denied.  There was so much paperwork to file and I was very confused with all the procedures and the deadlines.I called Bemis Roach and Reed and they were able to help me get all the proper paperwork filed, ordered all my medical records and with their help I was approved for disability.  Without their help I would still be lost in the pile of paperwork!!The attorneys and their staff answered all my questions and were very professional and knowledgeable.I trusted them with my case and I would recommend them to anyone who needs an attorney that cares.Mr. E

My wife was denied Long Term Disability from her job after an extended illness. I enlisted the firm of Bemis, Roach & Reed to help her obtain her disability payment. Lonnie Roach, and his staff, including Paul Cash got the results we wanted. They poured over countless files and Doctor's notes and worked hard to help her. They were able to negotiate a settlement that we were very happy with. The communication with Lonnie and Paul was outstanding. I was in almost constant contact with them the whole time. If you have been denied Long Term Disability Benefits or Social Security Disability Benefits, I highly recommend you contact Lonnie Roach at Bemis, Roach & Reed. They will do their best to help you with your claim.

If you want the best care and service for your disability case I recommend Bemis Roach and Reed. I especially want to thank Trisha Wilson, Bertha Howard and Craig Roach for assisting me with paperwork and support. Mr Lloyd Bemis was my attorney and he won my case. He drove down from Austin to San Antonio for my appeal in front of the adminstrative law judge. I was awarded benefits because he presented my case clearly and correctly with a common sense approach. Thank you so much Bemis Roach and Reed!!!

I could not have navigated through the complexities and endless requirements for medical records had I not obtained the services of BRR. In particular, Greg Reed represented me, along with several outstanding and responsive paralegals (Craig and Monica). Having been denied twice for written applications for SSD, I was encouraged by the positive optimism by Gregg that I had a good shot at obtaining an appeal, and ultimately a chance at presenting my case in person to a administrative law judge. In retrospect, had I not used the services of BRR, I would have just given up after the two initial denials. Getting back to the hearing, it lasted about 1 hour, and to my great surprise, the judge approved my SSD request at the end of the hearing. Another very important aspect of working with BRR, is that they gathered, compiled and uploaded all my medical records necessary for my hearing. This approval has lifted a great burden from my shoulders, and many stressful days from my life and my family. I highly recommend the services of BRR for representing anyone seeking disability benefits. Without a doubt, this is a long bureaucratic process, and getting representation from BRR was one of the best decisions I have ever made.

After being denied disability on my 8th hospital visit in 10 months and not being able to work, I contacted BRR and they gathered all the information for my condition.  After a lengthy uphill battle, they were able to sucessfully assist me in the disability process.  I highly recommend the team at BRR. They were always straight forward and kept me informed of the status. There is no way I could have done this on my own.

Mr. Lloyd Bemis was a pleasure to work with. He was honest and informative from the beginning.

I recommend Bemis, Roach & Reed wholeheartedly!  Greg Reed worked with me almost three years to get Social Security disability.  His paralegal, Craig Roach, was also outstanding.

Greg Reed and Craig Roach were wonderful in helping with my disability case.   Thank you Mr. Reed for reminding me that all 30+ years I have worked, I paid into the very benefit I was applying for.  Thank you both for your assistance, encouragement and hard work in getting my case presented to the judge.   I will forever be grateful to Greg Reed for his presentation of my case, my health and my future to the judge and just how much my health has declined.  I also want to say thank you to Craig for answering my questions, reassuring me of the process and helping me with my paperwork.  Lastly, when Greg was asked for clarification, he went the extra mile to go through thousands of pages of health records for the judge to answer the questions she had asked to support my case. I highly recommend Bemis, Roach and Reed for SSI/SSDI and any other legal needs you may have. Rachael P.

This is a wonderful law firm!  When I developed MS and was no longer able to work I had no idea the antics of the insurance company I was about to encounter.  They were literally "setting me up" to fail.  They were telling me everything was going to be ok and denying my benefits, saying one thing and doing another.  That is when I decided to speak to a lawyer for advice.  I spoke to a couple of different ones, and then Lonnie.  Best choice I ever made!  He is extremely knowledgeable of the disability law (good and bad), explains everything to me in detail, always takes the time to talk with me, and helped me get through a very difficult time.  He is very thoughtful, honest, knowledgeable, and direct which is exactly what I need.  He is on top of everything and he took a huge load off of my shoulders!  I absolutely highly recommend Lonnie and his firm!

I have already sent 3 people to Lonnie Roach.  He is an outstanding lawyer and was able to win my case.  He is easy to talk and he is a brilliant command over corporate disability law.

During the most difficult time we ever had to face, this firm somehow managed to make it easier for us. When our child was injured in a motor vehicle accident, they really cared. They took so much time to personally connect and make this horrible journey bearable. They really wanted to make things right for our child and went above and beyond. You can tell it is more than just a job for them. I am so grateful for them and couldn't imagine going through this with anyone else.

Obviously it was an unfortunate situation to be in, but I have no regrets with putting my trust in Aaron Herbert and his team. I’m very grateful for their hard work and persistence.

I've never had a car accident ever in my life but when I did I didn't know where to turn and I was recommended to them.

Aaron's knowledge and expertise on my case was unparalleled. I was kind of a "deer in the headlights" during my case because I've never been the victim of a serious car accident before. Aaron has been keeping in touch with me every step of the way and has provided me with a fighting chance. I highly recommend him!

Aaron is a stand up lawyer. Very clean cut and highly professional. He was very informative and a well articulated man. He kept us in the loop which we appreciated more than anything. We were compensated after 5 months of hiring Aaron to be our lawyer from getting into a car accident. Very quick turnaround. Can't complain.

Excellent Lawyer!  Aaron worked hard to build the best case for me and in the end the outcome is exactly what I expected. It was a pleasure to work with him. I am extremely happy how he handled the case and I would definitely hired him again if I needed to.

I was very happy with Reina's services, she is available even on weekends. I like that she called me back right away and I could tell she knew what was going on with my case, she knew what step was next and assured me of the progress. I have one other attorney in my past HE was NEVER available, I think some attorneys do not think its important to stay in contact with their clients, Reina knows its important, she now gets calls from any family or friends I have that are injured, thank you Reina

I was unsure about the process and what would happen in my case. I put my trust in this attorney and I am glad of how my case went. Reina explained the process and helped me with every singly step. I was nervous and scared about whether I would have to pay anything in the end and I know Reina set aside time each time I needed her. I was very happy with the case and how it went.

I especially liked Reina as my attorney. She filed a lawsuit in my case and I could tell she cared about my case.  We settled and she got me more than what I was expecting.  I highly recommend Reina, she's an attorney that listens, cares and loves what she does.

Tim O'Hare represented my family members when they were struck by a commercial bus.  The bus company would not take responsibility for their driver's bad acts.  Tim O'Hare sued the bus company and my family finally received compensation for their damages.  My family was treated with kindness and compassion.  The law firm was great and their aggressive representation had a great result!  I would recommend this law firm to anybody who needed the best!

Have referred several people to them in the last couple of years.  Great group.  They know their stuff.

Noemi Collie helped me on several legal issues I had and for VERY reasonable rates. Her knowledge of the law is obviously extensive in many areas and she was very available to answer numerous questions.

This lady is the best! She is the female version of Perry Mason. She's passionate, discerning, assertive, and a case conqueror. I've know Noemi for 17 years, she won my first case for me and fought very hard throughout the whole seven months. She has represented me on numerous occasions and she has for the most part won them all. Hopefully I wont need any legal assistance in the near future, but If I do you will be my first, second, third, and only choice.

I can't say enough about Noemi. She is kind, gentle, and compassionate to me, but a bulldog in the courtroom! She gives all she has for whomever she represents. She is reasonable, and worth every dime spent.

Noemi, I can't thank you enough for how you represented me on my case.  Initially, I was a little  apprehensive of what the outcome might be, but as soon as the hearing began you quickly gained my confidence.   I look forward to working with you in the future on cases we've discussed.

After several years of not addressing my back tax issues, I decided it was time for a resolution. After interviewing a few other companies that offer a similar service, someone recommended Bill Kunofsky Law Firm. After my first consultation, I felt completely at ease.

I went to see Bill with an issue regarding state sales tax.  He was knowledgable and honest in answering all my questions.  He was also very patient, and took a lot of time to understand my dilemma, and to offer up all my available options.  I had a hard time finding someone who handles this type of problem, and he was everything that I could have asked for.  Let's not forget to include this awesome fact:  he is both an attorney AND a CPA.  WOW!
 -

Bill is a hardworking attorney who has his clients best interest at heart.  While Bankruptcy can be a trying, stressful and trying experience, Bill can help you navigate it in a much easier way.  Taking the stress and burden of all the phone calls off your shoulders is a help in and of itself.  If you are looking for someone who will make sure all the "i's" are dotted and all the "t's" are crossed then Bill is your guy.  He pays attention to all the little details that can bite you in the rear later if they aren't caught early.

I was a victim of a horrible road rage & did not have the best attorney on my side. As a result, I racked up a ton of debt on my credit cards that already had an outstanding balance. Before the wreck, I had my debt in control, but afterwards, it was just out of control. I am a single mother of 3 boys, full-time student, full-time employee, & recent recipient of an ex-husband turned roommate do to his personal unfortunate situation. Things just spiraled downward and out of control to the point of severe anxiety and depression. I could not even complete my studies because all I could think about was "how am I going to pay for _______?" After spending almost $8k within 6 months & seeing NO dent made, I finally gave up. I started lawyer shopping & found Don. Immediately, I was impressed because he pulled over on the side of the road to get to know me & my situation. Now for some, this may not be anything, but out of all the lawyers I had talked to in my life, not ONE has stopped what they were doing to fully focus on my situation. Long story short, Don was willing to work with my financial situation & hectic schedule. One time, he stayed at his office until 8:30p.m. to sign paperwork. Don was there guiding me through the process whole way; start to finish. He was always honest, blunt, & upfront about the process, what to expect, & the reality of my situation. Due to my situation, Don was able to protect my assets that my children will inherit; my house and classic truck. Every email and call made were answered within a day no matter how annoying or freaked I became during the process. There are not enough kind words to express how much I appreciate Don Hood & recommend him to everyone. Even if you don't need to file bankruptcy, just do it so you can see what I am talking about hahahaha. (by the way, he loves Starbucks Doubleshot Espresso & Salted Caramel Cream so take one when you go). Don is one rare lawyer who practices what he preaches & showing compassion to others.

I found myself having to make a stressful and life changing decision of whether to file bankruptcy or not. But, after speaking with Don I knew that it was going to be what was best for my daughter and I. He didn't judge me for my poor life decisions that lead me to have to file bankruptcy. He truly had our best interest in mind. Don was professional and very efficient. He told me up front everything I would need to file and how the process would go from start to finish. He also answered any questions that I had even when I didn't have a scheduled appointment. Don made the entire process stress free. I would highly recommend Don to anyone that is trying to make the decision in regards to filing bankruptcy.

I highly recommend Donald Hood!A difficult and lengthy divorce complicated by declining revenues at our jointly owned business operations was threatening to ruin me physically and financially.  My CPA recommended that I meet with Donald to explore bankruptcy options.I was initially embarrassed and reluctant to consider bankruptcy.  However, Donald helped me to better understand the risks and benefits associated with the process. As a result of Donald's wise counsel, I made the choice to file for personal and business bankruptcy.Donald did a great job from beginning to end. He is friendly, professional, knowledgeable, deliberate and thorough attorney. We were extraordinarily well prepared and completed the entire bankruptcy process with ease.

Filing for Ch. 7 bankruptcy was one of the most emotionally difficult times of my life. I knew filing for Ch. 7 was my only option but was scared of the proceeding. Luckily, I came across the Law Office of Donald E. Hood. Working with Don I realized I was not alone in this process and it was a way to get my life back. Filling out the bankruptcy petition seemed as if it would be a difficult task, but the personal interaction and commitment to his clients placed my emotions at bay. When Don states that you can call him anytime, day or night, he stands by his word. By the time my creditors meeting came along I felt prepared and calm. No longer was I ashamed or scared of the future. I was ready to move on and live life again. Thanks Don!

Don is extremely knowledgeable in the area of bankruptcy and can easily explain the process, benefits, and consequences of Chapter 7 Bankruptcy to clients. He is responsive, professional, and dedicated to obtaining positive results. I would not hesitate to refer my clients to Don for bankruptcy issues, and have done so in the past.http://www.dehlaw.com/index.html

I was referred to Morgan and Weisbrod and Carl Weisbrod handled my husbands case.  I was impressed by his ability to navigate my husband through the process and help him understand the legal terminology and direct him on how to gather information from other sources important to his case.   My husband had not kept very good records or taken some necessary steps that would have made the process a little easier, but fortunately, Carl was able to see past what my husband was asking for and redirect him in a way that helped him more. He was able to get my husbands disability,  back pay and a monthly check for our son.  I am forever grateful and feel as if we can call Mr. Weisbrod at anytime, if we need anything, he is just that personable.

Social Security Administration is a challenging business to deal with, especially when requesting a Disability Claim. The process is tedious and time consuming. After my failed claim, I reached out to Morgan & Weisbrod, with the help of Cynthia, the paralegal at the firm was a tremendous blessing.  Let me also share this important information to those that are seeking Disability, don’t waste your time, just get the law firm Morgan & Weisbrod to help you expedite the process. They are diligent and forthcoming with any questions you may have. I want to extend my gratitude to the firm.

Attorneys Tom Cox and Rebekah Dallasen did an outstanding job in handling my case. Judges aren't known for giving criminal defense attorneys compliments but the judge hearing my case gave  Ms. Dallasen one. I was charged with  a felony CS over 4gs which got dropped to a misdemeanor  under 1 and time served thanks to Tom and Rebekah. Thank you both

I don't have words to express the deep level of respect and admiration I have for Atty Cox. He is very professional, respectful and excellent with providing  detailed information about your case. I really admired his honesty and his depth  of knowledge.  After making contact, through referral from an acquaintance, he without wasting any time immediately started working on my case and knew  exactly what needed to be done. He returned my calls, texts, e-mails promptly including early mornings, evenings and weekends. Very accessible. Mr Cox is forthright, knowledgeable and professional with an innate ability to keep a calm demeanor during trying times which reinforced my confidence in his abilities. He has a caring side that is authentic but states the real facts. He takes his profession very serious and his passion for his clients cant be topped. He provides to you exactly what he expects and needs from you and if you simply follow his lead, keep an open line of communication & pay the expected fees for his countless hours of work and dedication- You cant go wrong! He is extremely understanding and reasonable with his rates and well worth every dime!

Mr. Cox is the best criminal defense lawyer of Dallas. He would do all and anything for the best interest of his clients. He’s the guy to call when you’re in need of someone to defend you. He is a very well experienced trial lawyer, and that’s exactly what brought me to him. He knows his defense, and that makes him even more an exceptional criminal defense lawyer.

Tom has helped in so many ways with my troubles in the justice system. Everything from posting bonds for me, payment plans to getting plea agreements that help me deal with my addiction issues. He has been my lawyer for 15 years. Tom has become a close friend and I the one trust completely when it comes to getting the best results in Dallas County. I hope to never need his help again but if I do he is the only lawyer I would hire to represent me in Dallas.

This was truly an amazing experience for my family. We did a Termination/Step parent adoption. Throughout the entire process, Blanca and Sylvia were on it. They kept us informed of the process for court and all the necessary steps we needed to take. I couldn't thank God enough for bringing these amazing attorneys in our lives. They truly care about our children and take pride in their work. When we arrived to the court, Mr. Worrell arrived sharp and ready for court. I knew he could tell we were all nervous. He took the time to speak to each one of my children. Speaking to all 3, he asked them, "do you know why you are here?" They said "to be adopted" He made them and us feel at ease before we went into court. During court he called all our family up front to share in this experience. This day was a very emotional and fantastic day. It will always be a day to remember. From the bottom of our hearts we would like to say a BIG THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS FROM THE NEW JACINTO FAMILY!

We attended the FREE Look & Dine screening and were very impressed!- The atmosphere is beyond compare.  Beautiful, incredible$$$  architecture.  No skimping here - even Klipsch speakers in the auditorium!- The comfort is crazy nice.  Leather recliners, ample-sized eating tray, full cup holder so you won't spill your drink in the dark.  Large recliner fit my full size, too.- Service was GREAT.  Never let my drink go empty (2 refills without asking).  Full explanation of the menu, and available full bar.  Numerous wait staff to take care of you.  Fast, efficient, friendly.- The food was great!.  Yes, we did have a set menu, but it was FREE.  The set menu consisted of chips and salsa (wonderful), turkey meatloaf slider (perfect), and a nice sized grilled cheese.  The grilled cheese did have a hint of horseradish, folks.  Hot, fresh, gourmet.  We saw the future menu and it appears to have numerous selections that we want to give a try.- The management greeted us and couldn't have been nicer!-  Really cool PRIVATE restrooms - how about that!We can't wait until this place is fully open.  This will be a great weekend treat for us!Kudos LOOK!  Thanks for the evening!

New Year's Eve.2016... Excellent unbelievable Beatles trubute live band.. sold out standing room only. Fun.. Fun.. Fun.. party favors served at midnight.. Slight mix-up with my table reservations but the manager "Christopher" quickly resolved the problem.  Drinks were good, reasonably priced menu, and excellent service despite the large crowd.  I was so pleased I left a very generous tip and plan to visit this place again. Also, do not worry about parking... there was plenty of parking behing the building for only 8 bucks.

There are a variety of different theater options: IMAX, 3D (sometimes both IMAX and 3D), digital, luxury loungers. Different price points for certain days and shows. Senior Day is Monday $6.50. Tuesday is Discount Day $5.00 for a regular movie and discounts for all versions of higher price points. Theater is always clean, staff are helpful, bathrooms are clean. Most importantly snacks are awesome! Blue Bell ice cream and milkshakes.

The manager Maria Pinales is rude and inconsiderate. I took my kids to see Lego Batman at 2 o clock in the afternoon, and she told us to remove our baby from the theater bc she heard her say mama. I wouldnt go to this theater if you have kids.

I have been coming to this theatre ever since I moved to East Dallas 4/4 years. I have always found it to be clean well staffed and very reasonably priced. However, with this new seeding renovation, the movie going experience is the most comfortable I have ever experienced in the dallas-fort Worth area. And I've been to nearly all of them. The seating in this theater is powered seating which one all the way back still allows people to go buy in the aisles. It's extremely comfortable to watch a movie in this theater and each theater has been renovated beautifully. I highly recommend it to anybody who wants the best possible movie viewing experience in Dallas for a very reasonable price.

I really like this place and hope business is brisk enough to sustain it. It's older but kept up very well, clean and refurbished without losing the retro charm. The staff has always been pleasant, the popcorn and drinks fresh and.....those wonderful Lazy boy recliners and top sound system. A lot of the clientele is probably older than average, baby boomers like me. It is a nice alternative to other first run theaters like AMC 30 in Mesquite, which have all the movies but are a not the atmosphere and comfort I like.

Im not one of those people who get upset over little sh*t and write reviews but in this case I was very disappointed. I purchased two tickets for a 715 showtime I arrived there a few minutes late they sold me my tickets and when I walked into the theater the room was empty and nothing was showing. At first I thought I walked into the wrong theater so I checked all the other theaters they were all correct. I asked an employee and informed her that the film I had wanted to see was not playing in the theater that was marked for this showtime and all she said sorry it's to late to air the film. And it was only 745 My movie should have started not even a half hour ago. So I asked for a refund. Disappointing that they couldn't start the movie but not only that they couldn't even stay on schedule.

UA has RATS! I live close by to the theater and would always enjoy the convenience of being near until I came across rats! For about a year now I have taken account that UA is not only home to the largest screen in Texas but is also housing rats. This did not bother me too much for I returned until I had very poor customer service. Denied a movie for my whole family I felt embarrassed and was threat to leave by a non serving officer. You may not be treated as poorly as I was, but you may also not like rats. If you were also to be treated with lack of respect please do fight for your right as I only did by warning others. No one with power should abuse it by making others feel denied from their right.

I have two dogs with different needs.  I have a one year old Springer Spanial and a 14 year old senior Springer.  I have had a difficult time finding one place that can accomodate both dogs until I found Classy Canine Daycare.  The pup can hang out with a pack of higher energy dogs while my senior dog can chill with a pack that more suits his social needs.  Both of my dogs love to go to CCD and come home exhausted and happy.  The staff really knows how to make you and the pups feel very special.  Cleanliness is very important to us and it is obvious it is at CCD as well.  I love getting the dogs groomed here.  I love to watch them strut their stuff when they know how good they look and feel.  I know most of the staff by name.  They are all friendly.  The manager Jay, constantly impresses me with his dog knowledge and I respect the way he and the rest of the staff are always wanting to sincerely please you, the customer.  Give it a try...I know you will be hooked and your pup will too!!!

I have used the services of Classy Canine many times.   This place is huge. Impressive  building.  13,000 square feet total. ( 6000 sq. feet of four different large play areas).   The owner and staff ,are always friendly ,professional,caring and polite.   They cater to "dog people".   The facility is clean.    Classy has provided all of our daycare/boarding - grooming needs.   Getting to watch our dogs on the dog -cam, is a plus.   Really nice to view when we were on vacation.   Dallas-Ft Worth area needs more locations .   Easy access from either George Bush, or I - 635.     I highly recommend their services.

I've tried a few other places around town, but this place is the best by far.  People are friendly and seem to really care about my dog - and they've really gone out of their way to make sure I'm satisfied.  Plus, these guys are obsessed with cleanliness - I'm amazed how serious they are about keeping the floors clean and spotless.  I drop my dog off on days I know I'll be home late, and I can see from the webcams that she's having a heck of a lot more fun than I am!  I'd highly recommend them.

Very clean, very nice employees and the best place in North Dallas (or Dallas period) to take your dog for Daycare and Boarding.  The place has a bunch of large playrooms so dogs really have room to romp.  Unlike other places I have looked at or tried the owner is on premise most of the time and he is often at the front desk or in the playrooms not just hanging out in his office.  His office is in the lobby and if he is not to busy/on the phone he always comes out and greets you and your dog.  His second in command is great too and the groomer gives my difficult to bath jack russell the best most complete groom she ever gets - she just smells cleaner than anywhere else I have tried (even myself).   Give it a try you won't regret it.  I only wish they were places like this everywhere we live/visit with our dog.

I am fairly new to this area and have been to several daycare and boarding places in the area, and this was the nicest by far.  The place is huge, and they were happy to give me a full tour even though it was late in the evening and they were getting ready to close.  The people are nice and seem to really like the dogs.  I have only brought my dog in once, but I watched him on the internet during the day and he looked like he was having fun.  I will be bringing him back for sure. Thank you for putting up with my hyper dog and wearing him out.

I have been taking both of my pugs to Dr. Mc Cleery for about a year now. He is one of the kindest vets I have seen. He really takes the time to make your pets experience as pleasurable as possible. Neither one of my dogs contest going to see Dr. Mc Cleery, they get so excited when we pull up they practically run me over...haha. I work for a vet in Plano but would not even consider taking my babies anywhere but Animal Hospital Of Garland. The staff is friendly and the Doctor is AMAZING!!!Nicole

Dr. McCleery saved the life of my retriever mix who had a dangerous case of pyometra.   He is very matter of fact, but I knew when I consented to the operation, if anyone could save her life, he could.  She is as good as new today, or better.  She could have lost her kidney function--but she did not.   He was careful about everything, including diagnosis and letting me know what I needed to know.   And yes, his rates are very reasonable.
 -

 - 
I've used Dr. McCleery for 20 + yrs and he is great.  His office staff is also very friendly and all are animal lovers.  Doc saved a dog I adopted at 2 yrs old who turned out to have a bad case of heartworms.  That dog whom I loved dearly lived to be 19 yrs old.  Doc is matter of fact and doesn't waste time, but I know my pets get the best care there.  I don't need my vet to be a shoulder to cry on.  His rates are reasonable also.  I particularly am impressed with Doc today because my little dog went into labor and couldn't deliver.  I had her C-section scheduled for tomorrow but she surprised me this am.  I took her to his office, his staff called him at home and he quickly came to the office to deliver.  She & 3 babies are all fine.  Rate was much less than an emergency clinic I had to use on a weekend one time.  I highly recommend.

I like Dr. McCleery very much.  IMO he is far from money hungry.  Recently my cat had been having problems.  I'd spent over $600 at another vet who never got the problem fixed in spite of my telling her what I thought the problem was.  She insisted it was an upper respiratory infection.  I had to take my cat in six times, gave the poor thing three powerful antibiotic shots AND take-home meds.  This went on for several months..  My poor baby had to go through the stress of all the vet visits, shots and meds and still never got well.  Finally I took her to Dr. McCleery.  He actually listened to me.  After the exam and hearing about her symptoms and history he agreed with my opinion of the problem.  He did give her an antibiotic shot because she had a temperature, which I think was caused by inflammation from the other problem -- but he gave me medication for the other problem as well (hair ball).  She had to have three doses a day of the hair ball meds for a week, then twice a week thereafter.  She got better right away.  I only had to take her for one visit plus a follow-up just to make sure there she was responding and didn't have a temperature.  The other vet NEVER got her temperature back to normal.  I paid Dr. McCleery e less than $150, and that included the two visits, the shot and take home meds. But best of all my baby got better right away and was not suffering anymore!  He is a wonderful vet.

The staff at Cornerstone Animal Clinic have exceeded my expectations. They were kind to my Dog Snuggles, and take very good care of him. I don't trust easily, but when I do, I trust the team at Cornerstone to take care of my babies. In fact, my Snuggles was in love with the ladies there......he is such a flirt! I would highly recommend Cornerstone Animal Clinic to anyone seeking a veterinarian. -JAY&ROXY

A Review? More like a Testimony,  the Truth is there are really no mistakes in choosing people to do life with, Dr. Mike Escobedo and his family are members at our Church, Celebration Center in Frisco. We have known them for 4 years. We would have never expected to be in a life or death situation with our 2 year old Husky, Saint. We spent 4 weeks at the clinic with our Husky and don't know what we would have done with out Dr. Escobedo and his staff, they are more than just " a Pet Clinic"  they truly are a part of our Family now.

My dog Sandy has a lot of energy. When I get home from work I'd have to spend a couple hours just to get her wound down. Then we found dog daycare at Downtown Dog. She goes there and plays all day. And the people there are really good at getting the dogs to play together. When I get her home she's calm so we can go on a nice relaxing walk together or just hang out. It's great.

I LOVE going to this place!  My human used to take me to another daycare in Irving and they had a really small play area and she paid way more money. Less money spent on daycare equals more treats for me!  The humans that work there are welcoming and like to cuddle and play.  This place is huge - almost an acre - and I get to run all my energy off.  We get to be outside when the weather is nice and inside when it isn't. They give good baths here, too. I hate baths, but they have this blueberry facial stuff that makes me all relaxed. Don't tell the other guys - I'll lose my street cred. The best part is that I get to meet all sorts of new friends.  See you there!  - Zeus

Downtown Dog is a great place for dogs to play. Dogs from all the apartments around downtown don't get this kind of exercise enough. And when they come home they're happy and tired. Best of all they cost about half what I used to pay and the dogs are happier. Like I said, it's a great place.

I saw reviews on Google about this business but I kept an optimistic approach, because the reviews were a year old. I have an Alaskan Husky where most other groomers just do the shedding treatment. I took him there and for the first time since in six years I've ever seen him actually groomed he looks fantastic and he's not as hot during this Texas heat I drop them off in the morning pick thIm up in the afternoon service was excellent.

I've been using North Tollway Pet Hospital for over 5 years, I have several pets, who all have special needs (2 snakes, 1 dog, 3 cats.) I would not trust ANYONE else with the lives of my pets. All the staff there really takes time to FIND out whats going on, and the Doctors are BEYOND amazing. I am sad to see some bad reviews. I feel like some of them leave things out, the just want to complain in some cases. I realize it is going to COST me money to have my pets taken care of. That is part of the responsiblity of being a PET OWNER. I even called around a few weeks ago just to compare prices, and this clinic is right on cost with alot of the other vets in the area. I will keep using North Tollway Pet Hospital- because it's hard to find a vet that CARES as much as the doctors here do.[BTW, Dr. Stramel doesn't even work there anymore!! Some of these reviews to be updated :) ]

Oak Clips did a great job with Flora.  Excellent customer service and Mari is a very caring person.  She sent us home with samples of one of the kibbles they carry.  Flora-the-picky-princess loves it.

I've had three separate dogs training at the Garland location and people like Fred, Andra, Andy, Breyers, and Andra have helped me so much.  I strongly recommend this location for training, boarding, and grooming; you will not be disappointed!

Since the new owners took over in October this place has changed ENORMOUSLY!!!! The new look and the friendly faces made me very comfortable. The new owners were extremely nice and helpful.They took very good care of my miniature schnauzer and yorkie. I have to say my dogs didn't seem anxious to leave. Thanks for the great service and I really want one of those beautiful birds.

An Experience with Grooming Table :)  Niña is a lot more engaged with what is going on and a lot more responsive to me since her grooming. Thanks. On a scale of 1-10, a 10.  It might seem strange, and maybe Osbourne is getting spoiled, but recently prior to her grooming Osbourne had little interest in hanging out with her, but now he does like hanging out with her. In the past they have always got along great together though, but I guess now that Osbourne has gotten groomed regularly he expects more from other dogs or something.

Friendly staff, which is why I am giving 1 star, but within days after the visit, we discovered that our indoors-only cat contracted fleas and ear mites. What did it cost us? Akasha suffering from insomnia, itching, flea baths, being removed from the house 3 times (so far) during environment treatment and from ear drop treatments twice daily for 3 days (if the OTC ear drops work the first time)$300 for a useless insurance plan, $170-1st flea/ear mite med/env treatment$170-2nd flea/ear mite med/env treatmentShe still has them, so a Professional is coming next Thursday to treat the environment, courtesy of our apt management. We have our fingers crossed that this will be the final treatment. Otherwise, there'll be the expense of an office visit at a reputable clinic and for prescription meds.This clinic reimbursed  $60 of our $300 insurance plan that we only used for her initial visit. *the plan doesn't cover flea and mite treatment ****I want to stress that We have no way of knowing for sure if she contracted fleas and ear mites from this clinic, but it is suspicious that she got them immediately following the visit.

I have been to 3 different Veterinarians in the Dallas area over the last 15 yrs.  I was running into problems with over pricing and felt my vets were doing things that were not needed.   I brought our new Yorki Poo puppy to Dr. Moore.  I have never had a vet sit down and describe how to take care of a new puppy and explain kennel training from beginning to end.  Dr. Moore answered all my questions and never made me feel rushed.I then brought our 11 yr old Jack Russell to Dr. Moore.  Again, he did a great job and was overly helpful and spent a ton of time describing our dog’s situation with my husband.  I also like his reasonable prices.I have never been more pleased with my pets vet and would recommend him to anyone.

I have had three dogs and all of them have been taken care of by Dr. Moore of Northwest Dallas Animal Clinic; I have no doubt whatsoever that they have had the very best care possible!
 -

 - 
Dr. Moore never rushes through a visit and always takes the time to explain things. My dog considers trips to the vet to be a treat.
 -

 - 
Dr. Moore has been our vet for over 17 years!  Over the course of this time, he has provided exceptional care for our many dogs and cats.  His staff has always been polite and considerate.  I highly recommend his clinic and his services.  He has exhibited tremendous compassion, explained complicated procedures, and consistently provided exemplary care for our family of pets.
 - 
 -

 - 
Dr. Moore and his staff are very easy to work with and do a great job of getting to know you and your pet. They offer clear explanations of procedures and diagnoses and offer multiple levels of care depending on price and need. I would highly recommend Dr. Moore's clinic to anyone with a dog or cat.
 - 
 -

 - 
We have two beagles and we would not take them to any other vet other than Dr. Moore. He is extremely knowledgeable and skillfull with his diagnoses, and takes time to educate us about our dogs' condition.  Thanks to Dr. Moore, our beagles are healthy and happy and will remain so for a long time.

I've used this vet for various animals and for various reasons. "The cat whisperer" (as they call him) does wonders to soothe scared felines' nerves, and they're always ready to play with a pup. Because of them, we no longer need to spell V-E-T to avoid panic in our household. They're great.

I just wanted to take the time to thank Get There First Realty for the wonderful job they do handling my rental property in an incredibly professional manner.  Their staff has the expertise to handle anything that arises with rental properties.  The only reason that I felt comfortable purchasing rental property is because I know that you and your company will take care of the property management.

Do you guys ever sleep? Seriously, I appreciate the job you do.  Before I came to Get There First Realty I was with another realty company.  They cost me tens o thousands a year.  You guys provide positive cash flow.  I don’t know how they stay in business when you guys exist.  I can always count on you.P.S.  The other company was 8% and you were 10%.  I chose them due to price.  Most expensive 2% I ever saved.

I regretfully just gave my 30 day notice from the property I have been renting from GTF.  I would like to take this time to say what a pleasure it has been to work with GTF Inc.  When I found them, I had just went through a divorce, I had two dogs and GTF was very professional in handling any and all concerns of mine.  I would also like all to know how grateful I was for them to work with me when I took a mechanics position in Prudhoe Bay, AK, I was allowed to go month to month while I figured out my affairs.  I am moving out of state and will not have the chance to rent from GTF, although I sincerely wish they managed anything where I will be moving. Thank you very much for all you have done.
 -

I want to thank Get There First Realty and staff for the outstanding job you have done managing my properties the past year.  Prior to using GTF, I was using another property management company that by comparison cost me tens of thousands of dollars.  They listed the properties at lower rents, had log vacancies between tenants and rents were frequently delinquent.  It was common that tenants left properties in terrible shape and months behind on rent.  It was so common I considered selling the properties because the losses were so great.I reached the end of my patience when my old property manager for the second time “forgot” to list a vacant house.  I contacted you regarding taking over managing the properties I was slow to agree to change to GTF and you called me at least once a week.  During one conversation you said “think what it would be like if you owed me money.”  I switched to GTF and everything changed.  You raised the rents and filled three empty houses within 30 days.  the late payments became a thing of the past with only an occasional exception.  You also recommended insurance and property tax companies that help reduce my operating expenses.  Your staff is prompt at returning calls and are always helpful.  I am truly glad I found your company.  I pay GTF a little more than my old management company, but it is without a doubt the best money I have ever spent.  My properties generate positive cash flow for the first time since I have owned them. Add me to the list of satisfied GTF clients.

My husband and I are an older Australian Couple who have Rental Housing Property Investments in various USA States.  We have used Mark Kreditor of Get There First Realty since purchasing a condominium property in Dallas, Texas over 10 years ago.Mark Kreditor and all his staff have always provided us with prompt, efficient, competent service and have surpassed the performance of all our other Property Managers of our other investment properties in the Maryland and New York, and other USA states.  We only wish he could manage all our other properties in other USA states.  Mark has always stated things as they are with genuine proper investment advice that has always been correct. Living in Australia so far from our USA investments, in a different time zone, we have to rely heavily on our various property managers to be available for prompt reply service which Mark Kreditor has always excelled in providing.  In fact, he has always been available to contact either by email or phone to discuss our Dallas Condominium property at any time. Tenant selection and screening has been excellent with the last tenant in occupancy at a satisfactory rental rate for over 8 years.  With his company’s up to date computer systems they have in place, our monthly rental receipt reporting/repair billings, etc, is very efficient.  We would recommend Mark Kreditor- Get There First Realty to any Dallas, Texas rental property owner requiring the best property management company you will find.

I truly would like to take this opportunity to Thank you and GTF for the outstanding management performance that you have provided to me and my property.  From the beginning of our consultation and the processes to lease my property you were a solid winner.  You were able to find wonderful tenants and my payments have been processed quickly and always on time.  If I ever had any questions you and your staff have addressed them quickly and always made yourselves available.  This has been an outstanding partnership from the start.  Your management company came highly recommended and I now understand why.I would say to any property owner or investor wanting to find a solid and excellent management company that GTF “Get There First” is the only company that offers full service and complete satisfaction.  100% satisfied client and truly the only management company or property owners wanting to lease without the hassles.

The ultimate professional After having my house on the market for over 6 months, I placed it in Kim's hands.  In 10 days it was sold and closed at 15% above what I expected.  She handled all of the details and worked very aggressively to market the home to the right set of buyers.  We could not have asked for more.   Robert & Zee

Kim represented us in the sale of our house, and she sold our house when three other agents could not. Our home expired with three other agents in four years. She sold it in two weeks for full asking price. She then helped us find our beautiful new home in Mesquite. I would highly recommend Kim Roulias for all of your real estate needs.

I was in a financial pinch and I've always been skeptical about borrowing money from a "loan shark" but this place was different. The 2 ladies running the show were very professional and they thoroughly explained the entire loan process. The manager, Mayra, was very knowledgeable and professional and to my surprise I got my 1st loan interest free. I'll definitely keep this Cashmax in my phone book for future financial bailouts.

The best pay day loan company! I shopped around to other pay day loan companies and this one was the best with the best rates! No secret hidden fees! They have Monthly Title loans and the bvest referral program i have heard of! 100 dollars on title loan referrals !

I was needing cash for an emergency while speaking to a co-worker she told me about CashMax where they approved me over the phone , they even asked if i needed an appointment for that day.

I just moved here about 2 months! It’s been the worst experience ever!! The apartments are nice but management is the worst ever so dishonest !!! They will lie just to get you to lease with them, then at the end  they will say something different!!! Don’t lease with this Company!!!! They’ll find every little thing to charge you! They give you the apartments super dirty so discussint they really don’t care about their tenants !!!

It's interesting that the only ratings with any detail are the negative ones. It's not hard to make a few fake accounts on here or yelp to up the ratings.But, if you're considering moving to one of their properties DON"T. They may look fun but having your AC go out in the summer? having maintenance take days to fix problems even if it means a giant hole in the ceiling? If you don't mind that then good for you. They'll charge you thousands of dollars upon move out without giving you any LEGIBLE written description (a blurry iphone photo is extremely unprofessional and sketchy) of why you're being charged and will threaten you if you don't pay within a certain timeframe. ENJOY!

This is absolutely the WORST experience I have EVER had with a property. Everyone in the office has no clue what they are doing and never solves any problems. They just give you the phone number for emergency maintenance. Whenever I spoke with the emergency maintenance they were furious that they just keep giving out his number for things that only THEY can deal with and said it was such a mistake to have a contract with these properties because of all of their issues. Everyone failed to let me know there was a cooler/boiler system ONLY prior to moving in. It is not on the lease (even though they tell you it is). When I moved in I had no blinds and they told me I would get them within a week. It has been 7 months and still nothing. I have made repeated phone calls and submitted maintenance requests and they put that the request was “completed” but there are still no blinds!!!! You can’t get in contact with anyone and no issues will EVER be resolved. It is WAY overpriced for the terrible location and terrible staff.  DO NOT MOVE HERE if you like to get what you pay for because I can’t even stand to be in this sauna of an apartment with no AC in Texas. I have had several people step in to my unit asking if this is even legal for it to be this hot and stuffy, not to mention there are NO WINDOWS I can open!!!! Only a big one that you are not able to open where the sun shines in ALL DAY and makes it about 20 degrees hotter than normal because of NO BLINDS. Don’t waste your money with this property.

The people at Power Properties care about what they do. From the time I reached out to them on Craigslist, through my entire move from Arizona, to now they have been nothing but thoughtful, kind and ON IT.My leasing agent Katie is amazing at what she does and very clearly an awesome person as well. Very mellow and easy to deal with but gets things done. When I contacted her about apartments she offered to pick me up the next day and showed me everything I wanted to see and more. I had only been in Dallas a couple of days, so not having to deal with traffic and getting lost made the experience much less stressful. She was also kind enough to show me around the vicinity of the apartments I was looking at (ie grocery stores, restaurants, yoga studios etc). I certainly didn't expect her to do any of this, she didn't have to, and it impressed me.Before I had even decided whether or not I was going to live in one of their apartments, the people at Power Properties offered to store all of the stuff that I had brought out to Dallas so that my car wouldn't get broken into. Aaron, the Service Manager, literally unloaded my car for me and after I signed my lease he brought all of the stored items to my apartment. They even offered to let me stay in one of their furnished lofts while I was searching for a place. All of this is unheard of to me and I couldn't be more grateful.When I moved in, Katie asked me what I needed to feel comfortable in the place. In a few days I had floor to ceiling curtains for privacy, a new window AC unit, two doors removed/fixed and an updated showerhead. She proceeded to follow up on whether all of these items were working out a few days later. I appreciate the follow-through that Power shows in their business and Katie is a shining example.The timing of my move to Dallas was not ideal-- right around mid-late February during the ice storms. Please note I'm from southern Arizona Throughout this time Katie was checking up on me to see if I needed anything, if everything was ok with the apartment and even offered to take me to the airport when everyone was frozen in. Again, completely unexpected and above and beyond anything I've ever seen from an apartment.I had the pleasure of interacting with Daniel Davis, the General Manager at Power Properties on several occasions and he is phenomenal as well. He seems to be constantly thinking about how he can make the properties safer and more attractive inside and out for the tenants. He didn't hesitate to ask what I thought about some of the company's policies, my take on what people want and how my experience with Power had been. Daniel pays attention to and cares about the little things that I think a lot of property managers miss.On top of the people at Power being wonderful to deal with - I love vintage properties and theirs are badass. I looked at several other properties from various owners and none of them had the visual finesse that the Power properties had. Power obviously puts a lot of effort into making these wonderful old buildings convenient and stylish to live in while respecting and preserving their vintage charm. Some problems can be expected with vintage buildings but any issues I have experienced have been handled very quickly and I think that's all one can really ask for.Overall I think Power Properties is a company built with good people who care about what they are putting out there into the world. For this reason I think they will continue to be successful and I would truly recommend them to anyone I care about.

My husband lived at 6011 Gaston several years ago and has always talked about how much he loved living there and how it was the most unique space in Dallas to live. Since I am a student at Baylor down the street, I recommended a couple of friends to go visit the property a couple of years ago and they told me they were disappointed that it was under construction and far from being finished. I felt bad because of the recommendation. I finally heard that they completed all the properties so my husband and I went to visit the same building he used to live in and we were blown away.The courtyard and the apartments are some of the most beautiful and unique we have ever seen. The first thing we noticed was the new entrance and all the stainless steel trim they used. In the courtyard there is 20 foot tall arch cabana covered with vines, king size daybeds to lay on, all new outdoor furniture and a bronze angel fountain.Congrats to Power Properties for upgrading their properties to a whole new level!!

My girlfriend got a job in Dallas so we're going to be splitting cities, LA/Dallas. We had to get a place fast and these guys have a lot of great buildings to choose from. The only trouble was, most of the apts were rented. Luckily they had an opening and they got us an awesome place. The rental agent was super helpful, they even drove us around, because we're still getting used to the neighborhood, they even recommended a bunch of cool places in the area.Pros: Very eclectic mix of lofts, apartments, houses, etc. Great neighborhood. loved the hisotoric mansions, trees and greenery. Price. I rented an apartment that looked like it could have rented for a lot more. Crowd: Seemed like a really fun community. Definitely youngetr crowd. Didn't see any kids.Cons: Busy leasing office, had to wait 30 min to see a unit. Because all the buildings are in so many different neighborhoods, it took about 1.5 hours to see only 3 apartments. The styles of the places are pretty different, ranging from modern to more traditional, but all of it looked pretty cool.No gym, but the agent told me there's a huge new YMCA that's about to open a few blocks away. I checked it out and it looks pretty good. It was just annoying that they did not have more units available. But I guess that means people like it here. It's only been a week, but we are loving it.

This company did not keep their promise. They said the loan will be close within 21 days but my loan started since November 18 but now it is Dec 27th, we still dont know when we can close the loan. The people- Greg West and Terra that working on our loan are lacking of responsibilities. When I tried to talk to them to find out the time to close the loan, he hang up his phone. Never go for this company. Find the better one like the banks not this small company. Even I call his boss, no response as well.

We contacted Texas Lending several times and the best response we received was an impersonal, garbled email: "That email I sent you does contain a link that  you can put all info rt into my computer  Sent from my GPHONE" We have used Texas Lending in the past and had a good experience. However, it seems that in the 6 years since we last used their service they have become more profit-centered than customer-focused. Don't expect personal service, courtesy, or communication. There are far too many mortgage services in the DFW area to be subject to curt texts and unresponsive communication. Cute ads and broad marketing strategies do NOT a trustworthy or desirable mortgage service make. Caveat emptor...

Really easy. Don't know why there would be any bad reviews. Had me closed on a re-fi in 3 weeks with cash back. Started the process on 11/5 and closed 12/1. All you need is the proper documentation and BOOM. Thanks Chris Johnson for the easy transaction.

Valarie,                                                YOUR COMMENTS MATTER!We really appreciate the review you left for TexasLending.com a few days ago. Your review:Kathleen went above and beyond to get us into the home that we not only wanted but, desperately needed. She is the kindest banker I have ever had the privilege of working with. She is wholly professional while maintaining a level of communication that makes you feel like "one of the family" at Texas Lending. We are so grateful for everything Kathleen and Texas Lending has done for our family. Highest Regards...The William Wedgeworth Family

Beverly did an excellent job representing TexasLending.com and helping my wife and I get our home refinanced. Beverly guided us through the entire refinance process, she was very honest and informative. Bottom-line; Beverly delivered as advertised, saved us a lot money and the Powell's are very very happy with our refinance experience.

I can't get them to respond.  I feel like I'm being ignored.  They're too busy or something.  Really disappointed.  I financed my first house with them, thought I'd try again.  They are just too slow or not concerned like they used to be.

I would not recommend this lending company to anyone. After being told I needed a certin amount for cash to close for 3 weeks, on closing day that amount shot up by an extra 2 thousand dollars. When I fired back at the loan officer she magically "rewrote" the loan and my closing cost went back down.

This .com lender is what is to be expected with the secondary type market , which does not exist anymore  for a reason. The call backs from this company are one of the worst I've seen, closing dates will not be met due to lack of concern on the part of the lenders. I will never use such a company again. If you do decide to use them, good luck.

Texas Lending has excellent customer service and execution. Loan officers did a great job. The transaction was easy and completed all online, except for the closing. Rates and fees were superior to all the alternatives, nationally!

Do not rent from this company. When breaking a lease I talked to the representatives to see about starting to find new tenants they said they couldn't help and that it was my responsibility to find new tenants. Legally this is correct, but they went from not willing to work with me to court ordered eviction after 7 days of no payment of rent even though I tried to work it out in advance. If you want to have them manage your property, sure this company may be great for you. If you are looking to rent be prepared to be strong armed by this company.

Throughout the many years of being in real estate, I have had the opportunity to work with what feels like every agent, board and property management company under the sun. After working with Get There First, I was very impressed with the level of professionalism and organization. They are without question, one of the best I have worked with!

GTF is the best! They are very professional and focused and they get things done. My property was always rented and I always made money. When I decided to sell the property they handled it expertly and gave me great advice. Their service is outstanding!

Even though I live out of state, Get There First has been the best property management company I have used in Dallas. They made the transition very easy, and were able to get reliable tenants quickly. I receive my rental income on the 3rd of every month without delay. They keep in constant communication with me when necessary and I am very happy I hired Get There First.

If I could rate them a ZERO I would. They are horrible landlords. DO NOT RENT FROM THEM!!! I have been without AC for almost a month now and they refuse to fix it. They continuously give me excuses as to a hold up and I verified not once but three times now that everything they've told me has been a LIE!  I'm about to take them to court. If you are smart, listen to all of the bad reviews becaues they are TRUE. Don't get yourself invovled with these people because you will be sorry.

No matter what you do, DO NOT choose Get There First. I can assure you it will be the worst mistake you could possibly make. I cannot believe they are even still in business. The home itself was not bad, but the way this management company is run is terrible. They have absolutely no regard for the tenant. I would imagine that very few residents renew after there first lease term is up. They will attempt at every turn to stiff you, no matter how good of a tenant you may be. I have never been so appalled.

As a tenant, I pay my rent on time. I would not recommend GTF to anyone. They have awful service. They are not flexible with you. Don't trust they automatic payment method, it's a ripoff machine.

Theres nothing like sitting back and waiting for the money to roll in. It feels like that with my rental property and Boardwalk management. They take care of everything and I take the checks. They embody the reason I purchased another property to begin with and make that dream possible for me.

They are dishonest and will let just about anyone rent your property. They give false legal advice. Ex: I was told you could not rent your house for 2 years if you evicted someone for nonpayment. They are the only RP franchise not listed with the Better Business Bureau.

Thanks to Patty for her immediate attention to the water main break underneath our living room floor in Somerset II Apartments on Monday. Having such occur in one’s dwelling place is so unexpected.

In my 9+ years living at Summerset II Apts, I have had the opportunity to work along-side Perry Guest Property Management.

She is quick to please her tenants, and get things done around the property as they are needed.  Thank you Patty for being awesome!

DO NOT RECOMMEND, BAD COMPANY, BAD PEOPLEPerry Guest Co. is absolutely the worst management company.  Glenda Guest is an atrocious woman that lacks human compassion.  I had to call this poor excuse for a human being to report a homeless person vandalizing her building and she was actually upset about me calling.  Do not list your number as a number to call if you do not want to field calls especially when it comes to the safety of a property they manage.  These people like to pretend that they are fixing up apartments they buy, but they hire cheap laborers to make cosmetic fixes in order to hike up the price of rent.  The foundation in the building is causing the building to crack and have plumbing issues and all they do is paint, put fake snap hardwood floors, and some new appliances.  This will not fix the many plumbing issues or the fact that you have to worry the roof is going to cave in!  These so called workers will also be at your complex for all hours trying to complete these fixes for months. The owner Sasha is a face you’ll see often, but he is just a cheap salesman feeding you lies of a better place to live.  For example, an elderly woman taking care of her grandson asked these people for the decency of giving her 2 months’ notice if they were going to raise rent and they told her do not worry it won’t happen for a couple of months.  Not even a week later notices were sent out that everyone had 30 days to leave or pay the extra rent for 12 months.  I understand they are a business and money is the ultimate goal, but there should be more care for tenants who build their business and provide the cash flow they require to grow.  You don’t lie and harass people to get ahead. The people working for Perry Guest Co. lack morals, compassion, and generally are void of any human trait that make a person a good person.  Shame on them and shame on you if you use this company to manage your property.

I can honestly say it was rough at first. I was not sure they could do it. So much stress and worried about IRS putting a tax lien on me when I don't even make enough to live.But Janet Coventry from Plan B tax relief  pulled it off and did an excellent job and saved me thousands of dollars.

The people at Plan B are my heroes!! I was scared to death when the IRS told me I owed them over $400,000 but then the Plan B team took that weight off my shoulders and handled everything. All of them were wonderful to work with and I never felt like I was just a number. Long story short, I paid the IRS $400 total! Needless to say, I can't say enough good things about the Plan B team and I highly, highly recommend them to everyone!

Hands down this is the best law firm that I've used. Ms. Mathis and Mr. Carpenter was very helpful throughout the entire case. I mainly was assisted by Ms. Mathis and she was great. Any time I had a question or concern she gave me a clear explanation. Response times were phenomenal. I've never had to sit and wonder if they received my email message or phone call. I'm  still amazed at the service and outcome of my case. I know 5 stars are the max that you can rate  a company but they truly deserve 10+ stars. Thank you again for providing excellent service. I will definitely refer any of my friends/family that's in need of legal assistance to your firm. Continue the great work and I hope you all continue to thrive.

First I would like to say that I am completely at fault for falling so far in my back-taxes. I was w-2 then 11 years ago switched to 1099. Needless to say, I couldnt afford my taxes due. I waited and waited but was never able to catch up. One day I was hit with a bank levy and wage garnishment. I called Anderson Bradshaw Conusltants because enough was enough. They stopped the garnishment within two days. It took longer(of course) to completely fix my tax mess, but they did. Completely honest and worth it. definite recommend!!

I am a truck driver and have been for 25 years. For the past 10 years I went without filing my taxes. I have back taxes, a levy, A bank Levy, And my wages were about to be garnished. I called Anderson Bradshaw consultants and within seven hours they stopped my bank levy. And released my wage garnishment. I am on the road to being settled with the IRS and state taxes. Also, I can go back to work without any worry.

I didn't get what I thought I would get when I paid for my daughter's tax case to be handled by this group. She ended up paying as much as she would if we had just done it ourselves. I should have just kept the $3000 I spent with them. Didn't meet expectations they set up front. Not a good experience.

I was a bit nervous at first trusting a company I found online to help me with taxes, but John immediately put me at ease. I owed over $75,000 to the IRS and had a number of missing tax returns and the IRS had already put a wage garnishment on my pay and had just hit my bank account for a sizable chunk of change. Within 24 hours of signing up John put me in touch with an ABC Attorney who got me my money back from the IRS and stopped the wage garnishment. I was kept informed throughout the process and every step was explained to me to make sure I knew what was happening. At the end, I only ended up having to pay the IRS $2,500. I cannot recommend Anderson Bradshaw enough.

I came to Anderson Bradshaw with a $36,000 tax liability. After speaking with Mr. King, he put me in good hands with Josh Kronick. He immediately protected me from IRS Collection action, informed me every step of the way for what to expect from the process, and ultimately delivered me an Offer-in-Compromise that settled my tax burden for $500. I cannot recommend this firm enough. They gave me a fresh lease on life. Thank you!

When we received a letter from the IRS saying my daughter owed them over $18,000 for income in 2013, we nearly had heart attacks! Her U.S. income in that year was only around $5,000, because that was the year she started teaching in Asia. Calls to the IRS gleaned only a little information, but it appeared that an ex of hers had accessed her PayPal account, sold his products online, but not forwarded the information to her nor did he tell her about it. I found Anderson Bradshaw online, contacted them, and after working with Josh and Ted for a short period, they managed to get it all cleared up and proper paperwork filed to clear her of all liabilities. We could not have done it without their help, and I will be eternally appreciative.

I am a United States Navy Veteran, who recently found himself in hot water with IRS . They wanted all these old returns and W-2' s that I haven't seen in years . I called around for help but the tax preparers could only go back 2 years. The other tax firms wouldn't return my call. It was only when I contacted Anderson Bradshaw and spoke to Ted England that I was finally able to get the help that I needed. I am not some rich guy or some huge company ; however, Ted was willing to take the time to get my issue resolved. Thanks to Anderson Bradshaw Tax Consultants I am finally able to get my life back from the IRS.

I was paying the IRS $400 a month for 2 years and I was getting NO WHERE!  When I initially set it up I didn't realize how much they charged for penalties and interest.  It's down right criminal (but that's whole different story) Last summer, things got pretty tough for my wife and I, we were robbing Peter to pay Paul and we just couldn't keep up with the payment any longer.  I had spoke with a few companies a couple years back when all of this started, but they didn't seem like they could offer too much help.  Thankfully I found Anderson Bradshaw through YP and I'm really happy that I did!  I spoke with Ted, he was very patient and answered all of my questions through out the consultation. He explained our options and mapped out a step by step outline of how they were going to resolve our case. There's finally a light at the end of the tunnel for us and they saved us quite a bit of money in the end.  Thank so much for ending this nightmare & getting us that Fresh Start you promised

When I began my search for a tax attorney, it was my understanding  "serve this area" would have been completed in the state I resided.  My paperwork made it across the country from Los Angeles, California to Baltimore, Maryland.  The same paperwork had to be submitted twice, one for each office.   I would have felt more comfortable if the paperwork could have been handled once.   I know that I would have felt more confident  if I could have worked with the same person the whole way through the process.

I cannot recommend ANDERSON BRADSHAW highly enough. There is always a courteous person to answer my questions and I personally work with Bill Davis most all the time. He has dealt with all my inept questions and queries. My account is not completely settled but is moving right along and the results are definitely are meeting my approval! My husband and I had ourselves in a real mess and they are getting things worked out really well. If you have any doubts about this company...don't hesitate to HIRE THEM ASAP!

I'm happy to write this review. I called ABC Tax two months ago when the IRS put a lien on my home and levied my wages. I was in $85,000 in debt to the IRS from when I started my own business many years ago. I never made any money in that business and now the IRS is threatening to take everything I have. As soon as I was transferred to Jeff, he put my mind at ease.  He is very knowledgable about tax help and tax resolution. He told me that he can stop the levy that day. and that I could settle my tax bill for only 5k. You guys did what you promised and now that I am paying back my reduced amount, The irs is removing the lien on my home and now I have a fresh start.

My wife works as independent contractor and we got careless about quarterly deposits so after about 2 years we owed way too much. We looked around and this guy calmed us down and was able to get us some kind of compromise with the IRS  and payments that we can now afford. yes, we recommend them.

A tax preparer whom I have worked with for years turned out to be stealing from me. Michelle Moya Pearl stole my stimulus money, opened fraudulent accounts using my identity, and screwed me on my latest tax return when I began connecting the dots. Absolutely scandalous, this company is well aware of her wrong doings. Don't trust these people with your information or money.

Being legally bound to financial jargons all my life, I faced some tax evasion issues last year where I was going to be rendered superfluous by the court if they had acquitted me. Even though I was right in my own terms, with the help of OMG Tax, they efficiently discovered the fissures in the data I kept. It was truly an astounding experience.

Best plumbing Rocks!!!  Had a major sewer backup in our home on our sons birthday party.   the plumbers arrived and got to work quickly.  Brian worked on the sewer problem for nearly an hour then the water went swirling away down the drain.  At that point he recommend cambering the drain and we are glad he did.   We observed the condition of our homes sewer line and seen we had several root problems at different joint in our sewer.   They recommended a water jetting cleaning and as to my surprise removed nearly all the roots.   Hats off to the Hard working plumbers at Best plumbing who know they stuff.

I have to tell the truth....this company is not the type of company that is sympathetic to the poor...The owner told me he could replace my kitchen faucet for $125 ..instead his employees came to my house and told me they wouldn't use the fixture I bought because "It's cheap quality and all it's going to do is leak"...I politely told them if it's installed correctly then it won't leak....they got mad and stomped out...The owner called me later asking me what happened and why did I give a bad review...I told him what happened...he offered to install it for free...he come to my house 3 days later and stalls, made so many excuses until i told him never mind....I've never been the type to trust anything free and I didn't believe he would do it for free anyway....MY POINT? It took them an entire week to tell me something they could of told me over the phone....WE DONT WORK FOR LESS THAN $300....I got my faucet replaced  by a smaller company and they did use the faucet i provided I paid them $160 and everything worked out

Affordable heating cooling and plumbing is a really great and honest company. I called them out to repair my leaking drain pipe in the basement coming from my bathroom. They arrived very quickly, showed me what needed to be done. They gave me a really reasonable price. Actually I was thinking it would cost way more because it was a large pipe coming from the ceiling down to the basement floor. They did a fantastic job!

I called several big companies to have a water heater installed. We were told that it would take weeks before we could get an appointment. My wife suggested that I try a smaller company.

What a team these guys are. Jason, Dylan and Ryan. A week ago, They came to our rescue. I called A1 out because, I  had 2 basement drains that had just started backing up. They responded same day. They ran a camera and and snaked out the drain and found a drain pipe connector beneath the concrete was busted at the  base of my main house plumbing drain. . They dug it all up and replaced the section of the drain and 2 floor drains and ran the camera again. Because my pipes were old,  I went ahead and had them run a camera from house to outside sewer and snake it.  . They reviewed the camera results each time with me. because the outer drain appeared sluggish with some minor root damage and blockage out near the sewer, I had them run super jetting and that cleared  up every thing which they showed me the results form the camera. That save me thousands and thousands of dollars.  anyone else would probably have told me to dig up my yard  and replace all that drain pipe costing me thousands more that I did not need to spend. They did a great job cleaning up leaving no trail behind them  .  Thanks fellas for a great and job.

Jason and Ryan are first class. They came without ant appointment the first time for a drain problem and were honest. Told us that it was just too much rain and we had no problem with our drains. So when our hot water heater went out we called again. They were here within the hour. As long as they were here we had another problem with the toilet fixed. It's Saturday and they are here fixing the last plumbing problem we were going to put off until income tax refund time, but we saved enough money to have every thing done now.Ryan and Jason are professional and respectful at all times. Everything is explained before it is done with a price. I trust them both and A1 Bargain Plumbing

Kevin, who we happened to meet in Lowes and overheard our haggling over our dryer dilemma, was easy to approach and offered his services (since he was a seasoned plumber, YAY). We contacted him and he fit us in to install the dryer by putting in all new gas piping, shut-off valves and a properly coded job.  We're VERY happy with 'A1 Bargain Plumbing' and will DEFINITELY use him and his company again. I would highly recommend using this company. Honest, trustworthy and very professional.

We have had the name's we all hear of like Roto rooter out told US we had to spend 5,000 dollars to fix the problems...We had tree roots growing in the path of the waste going out to the drain..found good reviews on A1 bargain plumbing so I decided to give them a try..and it was the best call I made..they came out looked at it..said it was the worst he ever saw..said we could blast it with high pressure water and it would break it all up and last for many years and the price was reasonable for what we were getting..Roto rooter wanted 5,000 dollars to tear up my yard and pull up the roots ..I'm so happy that I found A1 bargain plumbing they were professional. it felt like you had a family member over helping you with your problem..if you got plumbing issues call them you won't regret the call it Will save you time money and headaches in the future

very honest plumber, I called another big name company and they wanted to dig up my whole basement floor, i called a1 bargain and asked them for a 2nd estimate because I really believed that I needed to replace my entire sewer, kevin came out and told me it just needed a snaking out, he did so and then camera scoped it for me and showed me that it was only grease blockage and laundry debri, I would highly recommend them to everyone and will only use them from now on. god bless you guys.

I have a rental home in Redford, Michigan and needed assistance in clearing a kitchen drain.   They responded and worked with my tenant to find a good time.   Once they cleared the drain, they advised that my outside drain was clogged.   Thank you for finding this -- otherwise, I would have had a problem in the basement.   They were very clean in getting their work done, cleaned up, and were very professional.   As to the price, I could not have been happier.   The outside drain was not a "hard sale" like with other plumbing companies, but information (and a very reasonable price) if I would like it done right then.   If not, they would be available when I wanted it handled -- and even that price was still very reasonable.  A day or two later, I had another problem with the bathroom, and they came back - determined it was the caulking around the tub.   This time, though, I was informed that it would need to be done, but I had time to wait on this repair.   That was good to hear and I appreciated the honesty.I have put A1 Bargain in my roladex and will be referring him to my family in the Detroit/Redford area and surrounding.   What a refreshing company to deal with -- honesty and integrity is hard to find these days and A1 Bargain Plumbing has it.

Dirty water was coming into my basement!!!!First off I used some other company (they were worthless!!!), I started looking online and off previous reviews from A1 Bargain Plumbing. I decided i would call and see for my self. Best thing ever... I spoke to Kevin who said he would meet me in an hour (actually took him less than that). He was very polite, professional, and knew what he was doing. Needless to say he "snaked" various drain holes, and fixed my problem. His price was very resonable. You can look for him online where they offer a 10% discount coupon. I would recommend his company to any one in need of a plumber :)

on a sunday early evening i was dealing with a serious problem with the drain line to my kitchen sink, after calling out a big name plumbing company with no results i called bargain plumbing and got the owner himself, he came out to my house and solved my tricky plumbing problem, the 1st plumber from the big name company was stumped and tried for 2 hours to troubleshoot with no success, his best recommendation was to replace the entire drain line !!!! i told him i need a 2nd opinion and thats when i called  kevin from bargain plumbing, he came out and  troubleshot the problem and had an answer within 20 minutes, it  was a ventilation problem to the kitchen sink drain line, not the actual drain, turned out to be a small bird that fell down my vent pipe sticking out of my roof, after about an hour i was completely back in business and educated on the way a drain line needs air from the vent to breath !   apparently theses types of tricky plumbing problems are his specialty,  reasonable prices, clean professional guy, knowledgable... will recommend him.

I had a bad blockage in my drain pipes that was backing up my toilet and shower drain really bad! I had did my best to try to take care of the problem myself but did not have any luck. When I decided it was time to call in a professional I originally called Roter Rooter, and schedualed them to come out. They didn't give me any kind of time window of when they would be out, all they told me is that they would call me back before heading out to my place. I waiting half the day before starting to call other places. I call A1 Bargain Plumbing and spoke to Kevin, and he told me that he could be there within an hour. He came out and assest the situation and told me that the best place to snake the drain would be from the toilet with the toilet removed. He offered for me to remove the toilet to keep cost down and thats exactly what I did. He left to attend to another job and returned once I had the toilet off and ready to be snaked. Because of the bad blockage, he had recommend installing a drain catch outside, so if this happened again, it could be snaked from outside which I decided to do as well. These guys worked both Saturday and Sunday and in the freezing December cold to fix my problem. They charged me $600 for everything which I feel was well worth it! I would totally recommend them to anyone looking for a good, respectable, fair and hard working plumber!

Very honest company, I was quoted 225.00 for a new disposal and when kevin came out and checked it he said it was a simple fix and unjammed it and pushed the reset button under the disposal and charged me 30.00 instead. I will only use Kevin from now on.

The drain in the floor of my utility room was clogged and the room was flooded...Kevin came out within 30 minutes of my call (on a Sunday!). When he arrived he even helped me carry some empty boxes out to my garage! He knew exactly what the problem was and got right to work! He guided me through each procedure that he performed and wrote reminders for scheduled maintenance on my receipt. Kevin took a few minutes of his time after he took care of my clogs and gave me an estimate on plumbing for a future project! I am very happy that I chose A-1 Bargain Plumbing and that Kevin came out to help!

Plumbing Express is a good company with quality service better than the rest.  My basement had water back up starting Tuesday night around 6:00p.m and I was calling other companies who claimed to be 24-hour service with nothing but recordings or some would say that they would have to schedule me for the next day, something that I was trying to avoid.  But by this time the damaged was already done so I started to call again which by now it was 5:00a.m early Wednesday morning.  I came across Plumbing Express LLC reading their few reviews and decided to give them a try going from the few good reviews. When I called them it was 5:30a.m got a recording but by 5:45a.m I received a call back from a young man by the name of Washington he gave me a time as to when he could get to me to do the plumbing, Washington then told me that he would be at my home between 7:30a.m and 8:00a.m. And sure enough even though we had some bad snow he called and told me that he was in route, by 8:15a.m Washington was calling me telling me that he was backing up in my driveway.  Washington is a kind young man who is very honest and also knows his stuff.  So I say all of this to say that I would use Plumbing Express as long as I own a home or recommend them to anyone who may have a plumbing probably.

And I was refer him to others. Thank you

I just wanna start off by saying these guys are awesome!!! I came home from working out of town to a major flood in my basement. I called these guys late in the evening and they came out immediately and got to work! I was worried financially it wasn’t gonna be good for me but they gave me such a reasonable price ! These guys worked their butts off for 19 hours straight.  Very professional, punctual and dedicated to what they do best!   If you need anything to do with plumbing I highly recommend giving these guys a call!! They do it right the first time.

I woke up to a huge flood in my basement, about 4 inches of sewage water. I was in tears trying to pump and snake it myself. My sister and I moved in together about a month ago and have been so busy moving and being single mom's. My house smelled awful and I could not fix the problem myself. My 4 year old niece couldn't use the toilet and was waking around holding her nose I felt horrible. We called any moment plumbing and they came right out!! They did not stop until the problem was fixed (hours of trying to get a snake threw roots) and we could use the plumbing again!! They were professional and also willing to work with us to make it affordable so we could get it fixed. Shout out to any moment plumbing!! Thank you.

I would like to give a special shout-out to Any moment Plumbing Inc. I am a mother of four children and my bathtub stop draining completely therefore I couldn't bathe my children or myself and when my fiance came home from work he could not shower. So due to the huge inconvenience I Outsource a company called any moment Plumbing via online and I gave them a call, to my surprise a technician was out within the next 45 minutes snaked my tub drain and got the water to go down for a very reasonable price the technician also used some type of high pressure water hose to flush the remaining the debris down my drain and make sure my tub drained correctly for no additional charges. I would highly recommend Any moment Plumbing Inc. to anyone who is experiencing plumbing problems.

After a long day at work I made it home around 11:30 p.m. Within the next hour I came to the realization My finished basement flooded one foot high. I found any moment plumbing inc. online and called them, and to my surprise the actual owner came out at 1:00 a.m. and got my water down and fixed my problem for a very reasonable price. I would highly recommend anyone with any plumbing issues to use any moment plumbing.

We started with a roof repair and ended up with a bathroom remodel.  It turned out beautiful !  They paid special attention to detail and really cared about everything we wanted.  We were very impressed by their customer service, competitive price and promptness.  It is reassuring to find a company with such great work ethics.  We recommend Great Way Home Solutions for all your home improvement needs.  They will be our only call for all our future home repairs.   ( I want a new kitchen ! )   Thanks for making what could have been stressful an enjoyable experience.

Great Way Home Solutions is the best!!!! They do excellent work for great prices and are very knowledgeable and friendly. They have helped me on various home improvement projects from remodeling my bathroom (which is beautiful, I had an ideal in my head and they made it come to life) to fixing broken pipes and hanging a ceiling fan, there isn’t much of anything this company cannot do. I would recommend Great Way Home Solutions to any and everyone!

I have used Great Way Home Solutions for various types of home improvement projects. With that being said, there's just about anything they can do. If perhaps there is an area of work that Great Way isn't familiar with, they will research it and give you their honest feedback about how to pursue your project. I felt like the advice and work that Great Way provided me with was the same as if they were working on their own home. I will always go to Great Way Home Solutions for any home improvement before anyone else.

Happy to recommend this plumber.  Used him twice now.  And how's having a water heater installed and operating in 2.5 hrs after the phone call for help?  That was way faster than I expected.  Feel that he's an honest guy running an honest business.  Fair priced and quick response both times.  It's nice to not have someone stick it to you when you suddenly find yourself in a time of need.

Mr. Sam Ciamillo, the owner, is one of the nicest people I've ever met. He goes over and above what is necessary to help his customers. While I have not used his company's service (yet), I did inquire and he answered all my questions plus he gave me great advice on how to deal with my particular problems just in case I decide not to use his services. If (or when) I decide to have my duct system cleaned there is no question in my mind who I will call.

I am really pleased with the service McCoy Plumbing provided me.

These guys are great.  Four years ago I had a sewer backup issue and I had called Roto Rooter.  They came out and gave me the run around and charged me for pretty much doing nothing.  Putzig Chuck Plumbing & Sewer came out and took care of it.  Just recently I had the issue again.  (Tree roots)  I called them again and they came out.  The next day we had another back up and they stood behind their work and came out and took care of it.  I really appreciate having someone I can trust to call when I have plumbing/sewer problems.

I am a first-time home owner in the Livonia Public School district/City of Westland, Michigan. I didn't realize how important it is to have a good, trustworthy HVAC company, until my heater broke. Our furnace broke on a Sunday, during a blizzard.  I called several companies, most of which didn't answer and never returned my call. Household Heating & Cooling was the only company that could come for repairs within my desired timeframe, and made theirself available immediately. When I called, the Owner answered and he even tried troubleshooting over the phone to avoid having to charge me for coming out on a Sunday, to save me money. The Household Heating & Cooling Service Engineer/Contractor was very professional and knowledgeable with many years of experience and expertise in the field. He explained in detail what the problem was and provided solutions. He made the process easy. He also explained in advance the potential costs. He was able to quickly find the part we needed for a very old unit AND he gave us a great price. #economical I also would like to note that in addition to diagnosing the problem, he also checked the rest of the components of the unit to ensure the entegrity of the appliance itself, before recommending replacing that part.  I now feel good about our furnace. John provided great suggestions, communicated with me throughout the process so I always knew what was going on and how long to expect the process to take. The Service was exceptional from the first phone call through installation.Every single person I encountered through this experience was courteous and professional and treated me as a valued customer. The repair appointment was fast! They arrived when scheduled and fixed my unit in less than 1 hour. He showed me the new parts and even thoroughly cleaned the entire unit after replacing the bad component. They even cleared our snow and ice from my front porch before they left!  (A large mound had accumulated from the drift during the blizzard, and they had to chisel it out) Household Heating & Cooling definitely goes above and beyond.  They will forever be our local HVAC company. I am 100% satisfied with the service and look forward to using them in the future.I will highly recommend HOUSEHOLD HEATING & COOLING to anyone needing a trustworthy heating and cooling professional.

I called several big companies to have a water heater installed. We were told that it would take weeks before we could get an appointment. My wife suggested that I try a smaller company.

I don’t usually leave reviews, but Big Jim’s Plumbing is the place to call.  I had an outside sewer line problem that for 12 years, no other plumber could fix.  Big Jim immediately came over, diagnosed the problem, snaked the pipe, and sent a camera through the line.   Fantastic service, and a very reasonable price.    I referred him to a friend and she was also very satisfied.  No complaints!

The level of knowledge and the expertise in cleaning out the drain to our drywell was outstanding.  Glenn was so knowledgeable and patient with our questions.  He spent a lot of time troubleshooting our basement water problems.  In the past we had another company come out and send a camera down from the sump well out to the dry well and they couldn't find the end of the pipe.  Glenn found the end and reamed the pipe out twice to make sure the water flowed cleanly.  Just outstanding!

I love Daylight Christian Center Church and my Spiritual Leaders! I have never attended a church before that taught the true principles of Faith and prosperity! I have learned to tithe and give offerings and God has blessed me with His Goodness. Daylight is equipping the congregation with great revelation knowledge to take to the world to share God's word. I don't know where I would be if I didn't listen when  God came for me. And I don't ever want to find out! I love that I learned how to walk by faith and not by sight. I learned how to love and forgive people and even myself.  My life has changed tremendously since I started attending Daylight Christian Center Church. I have had challenging days, but I was taught the tools to defeat the enemy and to keep on going because I do not lose, I win! I am the righteousness of God! I encourage anyone who wants change in their lives and is wanting new results, to come to my church for one year and apply the principles that are being taught from the pulpit, as my pastor would say "Your life will never be the same again, I guarantee it". I am living proof!

Daylight is an AMAZING ministry! Here at Daylight you learn about kingdom;and how to operate in the kingdom.I've been in church all my life and have never expirenced teaching like this. I now know I am what God says I am, I can do what God say I can do, and I can have what God says I can have.I could go on about what ive learned here at Daylight. All I know is there is no other church I'd rather be than in Daylight!

U have been attending Daylight Church for some years now. I have seen and experience enough to know where the spirit of God is. I have never learned at the level from first stepping for in Daylight compared to all the years before now inn other places. The heart our Pastors Dr. Jerome Talley and Dr.Theresa Talley of wanting to help see others grow in the word of God As they have, even before starting this ministry they were leading people to Christ and living according to the word by what they were taught and now they teach how they live. They are Holy examples of order, Faith in God's word not taking down no matter what people that don't understand God's word said and it shows in their lives. Everything we learn they teach straight from the bible and when you allow the holy spirit to lead you, the word and principles of the are followed you will experience in every area of your life that you apply those principles increase of prosperity, good health, your family and job or business thriving. If you choose to or not work these  principles is where you will see or not see what you have been looking to see come to pad pass in your life. I love my Pastors they deserve the best for all of their years of sowing and giving into the Kingdom and peoples live as the bible says the have also reaped from their giving just as they have taught because they are great examples of God's word lived in the flesh when obedient to  God's word and not man's word the world's way of living.

Everyone should be attending this church! Don't pay any attention to the bad reviews of this place. Daylight Church IS NOT a cult! Pastor Talley and his wife are GOOD PEOPLE! They don't need the money to make them prosperous. They do it walking by faith and trusting in Father God. The only reason that the other two people have anything bad to say about this place is because they are not living the life that was promised to them. They probably weren't giving God what belongs to Him, not expanding their minds beyond their lifestyles or circumstances.I will testify for Daylight Church, my Under-Shepherds, and all of the rest of my church home when I say that.... 6 months ago I was a wreck and the devil had me by the hand. I was depressed, suffering from lack, and lost my way in life, and even sometimes wanted to take it. I had no idea that in the time I spent at this wonderful place with these beautiful people.... that I would gain so much. Thank you Daylight. This really is the best church in the world. :) Join us!

this place is a cult!, they are not telling you the truth. the pastor drives 100,000 dollar cars and most of the congregation dont even have cars. i was a member of this church for some time and i can tell you the truth that they will take as much money from you as they can and never stop! The try and micro manage every level of your life. they have sermons about other members that leave the truth and the worst of all they preach fear. they make you fearful of leaving the church even when you see the lies that they preach. you cant even get married until the pastors say its ok. if you check their facebook pages and website, they are only promoting themselves, theres barely a picture of the congregations. the whole church is just about serving the pastors and what they can get from you. The pastors are not approachable, the youth in the church are immature and unfit for ministry at best! DO NOT ATTEND THIS CHURCH!

This is a church with a pastor that takes advantage of people and their money.  This is a church that has a pastor driving a $80,000 vehicle and wears $500 coats, and has no respect for poor people unless they are handing money to the church.  It upsets me that there are people out there who call them selves &quot;Gods Children&quot; can be so shaddy and ungodly.  Before you join a church you better find out if there there to teach you and save you or to rob you and take your money!!!!

Please ask questions pertaining to the reasons of the reports most people in the wrong will not call you to their home and prank callers I would assume call with pranks frequently not once a year.

TERRIBLE!!!!! It's Monday morning March 30th, and as if I don't have enough to take care of,one of my machines was vandalized over the week end and I'm sitting on the damn phone trying to make a police report and no one will answer! Calling 911 isn't appropriate seing as it's not a life or death situation, however, I've got two workers sitting there doing nothing because I told them not to upset the "crime scene". From my stand point as fleet manager wasting money is about as 911 as it gets! If the number on the website is incorrect someone should fix it. If I ever decide to become a criminal, Warren will be my playground every Monday morning!!!!

In January 2 men in a white van with a handicap license plate tried stealing my dad's truck, and the police did nothing with the crime scene. Today same guys, same van, and police did jack again. They have no respect for the laws and regulations they are suppose to enforce, because they don't know any of them. They don't know how to do their jobs, and are not qualified to protect our city. To be honest I hate the gun laws in our country and wish they were stricter, but if you felt there was a reason to have your own gun I wouldn't disagree in this city. Nothing but incompetent jackasses. They think they're above the law, and nobody especially police are above the law. I wouldn't be surprised if they hire ex-convicts and felons.

Department of Human services in Hamtramck doesn’t even deserve a one star rating from me. Most of the phone receptionists and workers are very rude, mannerless and disrespectful. They don’t know how to treat anyone nicely without insulting and forcing them to keep their mouths closed and let them only talk. Moreover, they close your benefits suddenly without notifying and falsely claiming that you haven’t returned paperwork when you actually did and on time! They are ridiculous and unbelievable unethical workers. I request the director/manager of this place to check and monitor  this place and its workers because they don’t work properly and this is why they end up blaming clients for not returning paperwork when they actually have. Ms. Lejeune, a caseworker is an example of such activity. Please observe this place for dishonesty, they are not serving humans, they are oppressing humans.

Where do I begin? Everything about this place screams "ghetto trash." You have to speak to the employees through a microphone behind bullet-proof plexiglass. Lovely. But that isn't even scratching the surface of how awful this place is. The typical government union workers are rude, unhelpful, and utterly useless. The "case worker" assigned to me was absolutely awful. I was scheduled for a phone interview at 9:45am on a specific date. I waited by the phone all day, and she never called. I then received a letter in the mail claiming *I* failed to make my appointment. Excuse me? She eventually called me 4 DAYS after my scheduled appointment. Which brings me to one of the most frustrating things - they NEVER return voice mail in any reasonable amount of time, so get used to waiting 3-4 days for them to call you back. When I became fed up and emailed my case worker because she refused to return my call,  she had the audacity to berate me for doing so because she "doesn't do email." Unbelievably unprofessional. I hate everything about Macomb Co/Warren DHS. I wish I could give it 0 stars.

DHS is governed by the Dept. of Agriculture. If you feel that you are wronged by a caseworker I would suggest contacting them with your complaint.  (312)353-6664If you reach a voice mailbox, leave your contact info and they will call you back...The number listed above is for the Chicago office and they oversee Michigan DHS Offices..

I can't really judge on the workers since my so called worker has yet to return any of my phone calls but did notify me by mail that I was not approved for the medicare assist program thing due to the fact that I do not have medicare part a even though my medicare card states otherwise and I filed for medicaid  and I faxed in everything that I was asked to and the letter stated I didn't. So I'm at a loss as what to do since I cannot get into the office because I cannot drive due

Hideous awful terrible, words just can't describe how bad this office ls! God help you if you need help you're not going to get it from this office. The workers there do absolutely nothing even in cases of extreme emergency. You will never be able to reach them their supervisors or their supervisors supervisor. Because of their Union the workers simply cannot be fired I have heard this from a number of extremely reliable sources. What they do all day is simply beyond me, my guess is they play video games while people starve, freeze to death and endure hideous hardships because they are completely without conscience! In my opinion based on my experience and the workers I've had these people are sociopaths who lack empathy and conscience of any sort whatsoever. I cannot stress this highly enough. If anyone reading this review knows of a way to do something about this please post it on the Internet. You have no idea how much suffering these people are causing. It's a travesty.

Brandy Guinn Payment super at DHS in Pontiac Mi is a racist. Not only that she called me stupid not once but three times, asking me if i could read english because out of the 100 pages ive sent the office i forgot to sign 1 - yes one page.  Rather then telling me she closed my case, when i filed an appeal she proceeded to cal me stupid.  I told her i was not going to be talked to that way I had my representative call her and she proceeded to tell my representative i was mental and needed help.

ZERO RATING FOR THIS OFFICE.  I've been trying to reach someone for three days.  I now find my rep is out of the office, a temp is handling her cases, and her mailbox is full.  I can't connect with someone and I received a letter that must be handled now!  This is unacceptable.  I left messages with no return call.  Is this the best the State of Michigan DHS can do?  The general operator was rude when I finally got her - and she transferrrd me to a supervisor at my request - but again I had to leave a message.  I realize times can be difficultt with low employment - but this is ridiculous.  DHS made an error - and when I try to call back to resolve this - I can't reach anyone!  ZERO RATING.

I have been trying to get the street fix in front of my house for three years!!! Had a water main break, city fixed it... A month later the street area that they tore up started to sink!!! Three years later some cars cant even pull into my drive because street is too low and new driveway is splitting apart!!! REPEATED calls to the city / water department is useless!!! Now I get the news that the new garbage pickup is going to be by "Rizzo"!!!! Yes, the under FBI investigation Rizzo!!! Did our illustrious major and city council even check on the reputation of this company??? Did the phrase "kick back" ever get brought up mr. mayor??? YOU PEOPLE LOST MY VOTE!!!

The DH government website is abysmal.  It contains very little, if any, useful everyday information for citizens.  I went to the city's area on egovlink.com and found more confusion and irrelevance.

I have been a resident of Dearborn Heights for the past 32 years.  I have watched the city improve and spiral down SEVERAL times.  Currently I feel the city is on a downward spiral.  I NEVER see cops unless it is at 7-11.  The streets looked filthy, codes are not being enforced on EYE SORE HOMES.  For instance my neighbors back yard looks like a junk yard, cat size rats!!!!  I feel the MAYOR NEEDS TO STEP UP AND GET CONTROL!!!  Last winter my side streets were HORRIBLE.  Hopefully this year will be better being that I live on an emergency/school route!  The trailor park on Pelham and Ziegler is NOTHING BUT TROUBLE and I NEVER see cops patrolling through there, IT'S FULL OF DRUGS, DRUNKS AND TROUBLE!  STEP UP MAYOR AND GET CONTROL!!!

With the flood on 08/11/14  we have only 45 days to put in a claim with the city, I put in a request for the form over a week ago and still haven't received it as yet, I have called back to DPW Dept. where you are to call and request.  I was told that the Mayors office has sent all forms out and she didn't know what else to tell me..We only have 45 days to put in for the flood claim and now I only have 31 more days left to get the form and send it back in for them to review it....Am I going to have to call the Media about this issue sense Dearborn Heights is not sending out the forms for claims?????

The Dearborn Heights Water department is one of the worst. If you have an emergency after-hours, you listen to the recording and select emergency and it hangs up on you. Also, if you ever need them to come out to your house, you better stand there waiting for about a week and they will show up as they please. The drivers are liars, and the people operating the switchboard are rude, and its astonishing they actually still have a job.

I just moved to Dearborn Heights, MI and I have to say i feel very safe in this city. The police are everywhere, including constant patrolling of the neighborhoods. They will even do a driveby if you request one while you are on vacation. I am impressed with the police force of Dearborn Hts, Thank-you!

Obviously these people need help because it doesn't make any sense for them to keep people on hold the way they do. Every time I call I am on hold for 2 1/2hrs or longer and that is ridiculous. The recording claims if u hang up u will not lose your place in line but I don't take that chance and just hold the line on speaker phone. They need to hiring the people trying to call this place to try and have better service for those trying to take care of business. This place is horrible and doesn't deserve any stars for ratings because the line stays busy. SMH.

well so far i can't get a hold of the phone number to any locations except grand rapids mi. and your phone lines are always busy,no one person has answered the phone i've called lots of ample time's! this is not good cummunications with good buisness elthec .  The things people say about your company is reflecting back onto you,and is not looking good for your images. you need better people skills, and more understanding of the people's needs. i hope that this will let you improve your buisness in the future. and sorry for bad spelling only using left hand and poor spelling skills. thank you stella doss

I appealed my unemployment decision. I called for a couple of weeks finally reaching someone to only tell me to appeal. After appealing  a couple of weeks went by and I continued to call for 3 complete weeks since uia told me a decision takes 1 to 6 weeks. Well im going into my 8th week with no response. I have called numerous times a day from before the office opens to right at 8am. No matter what times I've called it goes straight to the automated service stating the overwhelming calls and they cant answer mine. You cannot ask questions online as they say if you've already filed an appeal. How does one conduct business if no one answers the telephone and there is no way to check an appeal. As professional as I am I'm just not understanding how business is conducted in the department. Further I'm wondering how those that are less fortunate that I can handle business if they face these obstacles. Thank you UIA for any professional solutions you can offer.

If they answer the phone at all.  Tried to call them for 3 days to talk to an agent (number 6), and all I got was a recording saying that all agents are busy try again later.  Usually you will be able to leave your number and they call you back.  They just don't want to answer the phone if it gets busy.  Very poor customer service, but hey, its the government what do you expect?

First of they are absolutely not open mon-sun 24 hours. If they were then it might be a little better. They are actually open mon-fri 8am-9pm. Try to call them before 8 and after 9 the recording will even tell you. It's pretty much a run around game with them they say one thing then when you call them out on it they get all hissy at you (that's awesome customer service) they are however very informative on how they are screwing with you like you are nothing to them. They claim that you can protest something but it's only if someone from management decides to read it. If there is no one available it hands up on you. If you call 211 for help and no one can help you you hit a button and it saves your call order number and make and then... They call you back. Don't for online because your internet will be shut off before it's all through but if you call you have to do it constantly. Helpful tip to get the dumb recording to shut up when you call so you don't have to wait the 20 mind it takes for it to finish wait until it starts running the program (talking) then hit 6 for customer service rinse and repeat.

I went to renew my tabs on October 5th 2021.  There was only two people at the counter and noone in line.  The girl at the desk told us she had no openings.  It was by appointment only.  (Again nobody was there).  She told us to go to Kroger to the kiosk.  We left out of the door.  Thank God for the Security officer (female) asked us did we do what we came for and we said no.  She took us back inside and we were seen and took care of everything.  They need a new person in the front instead of a young girl looking at her phone.

Outrageous wait time. Customers lost and confused because there is no direction or method to the way they serve people. Numbers are disregarded depending on what you need done, but which line contains what is left for your own figuring out. Short staffed. Some of the staff short and rude when answering questions and walk-away before knowing if they even answered the question.

Terrific experience with Mrs. Widenbaum as my attorney during my bankruptcy. She went above and beyond what was called for.  She was professional while being caring and helpful. Took care of everything in advance so that I didn't have anything to worry about when I walked into court. I was literally in and out of the courtroom in 10 or 15 minutes and most of that was waiting to be seen! I can not say enough great things about her or her staff. Would recommend her to anyone and have done so to my family and friends who need an excellent attorney.

Walter Metzen of Metzen & Associates made my Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing practically effortless on my part while administering my case in a professional and expeditious manner. I am so grateful to have found Mr. Metzen. I was overwhelmed and needed someone I could trust to handle my financial matters so I could focus on other pressing issues going on in my life. When I saw the reviews of Metzen & Associates I contacted the Detroit office immediately. Walter took my call, explained the process and answered all my questions. He was professional, knowledgeable, patient and respectful throughout our conversation. By the end of the discussion I knew Metzen & Associates would manage my case while maintaining the highest standards. Within three months of filing for chapter 7 Walter informed me that the bankruptcy judge had granted me a discharge. During the entire process, from start to finish, Walter responded readily to each of my emails and calls with professionalism and a friendly demeanor. Even months after my bankruptcy was discharged Walter continued to answer questions I had that helped me resolve other concerns. I highly recommend Walter Metzen and the Law Offices of Metzen & Associates. They are a firm with integrity.  I cannot thank them enough for the support and assistance they provided me during a very difficult time of my life.

Attorney Rowland Short is the best counsel you can have in Wayne, Oakland, Macomb counties hands down. He is very respectible to his clients no matter of the charges you may have. He is down to earth and knows every client needs special and personal attention. If you need the best you need to call Attorney Rowland Short.

I retained attorney Rowland Short for several traffic offences I received over a period of 3 years.  Not only did Attorney Short get all my tickets dismissed, it did not cost me a arm and a leg.  He also handled a felony (CCW) case for me in 2010.  With his expert team and superb knowledge of the law, I was found not guilty of that charge and was very happy with my representation. Attorney Short is a superb lawyer and very professional.

I  would positively recommend Attorney Short, after meeting him- there wasn't more concern about what I had in my wallet,where I lived or what I drove, it was about the serious crime that was before me,I made the right decision. When you face a lifetime situation you really need a fighter and he is a true fighter. Attorney Short sat and conversated with me, not about what could've or should've happen,he only  concentrated on how to rectify and prove my innocence. Im very grateful for his outstanding service.

It was my pleasure to have Attorney Rowland Short represent my son. His dedication and honesty through-out the entire trial to his clients is incredable. I'm not very knowledgable about law,but Attorney R. Short  elaborates so you would'nt be confused or misled. He's highly recommended by me.

I retained attorney Short in 2011, that was one of the best decisions i've ever made with a very complicated case. The moment I met with attorney Short, I knew he would give his best. My family and I were so impressed. He's very thorough,efficient and shows conern. He is a winner!

Bill was the absolute best attorney I could have ever asked for! Not only did he listen to me, but he believed me that I was innocent of the crime I was being accused of. He was honest with me about all the steps or possible outcomes. By hiring Bill Colovos and following his expert legal advice, he got my case dismissed!! That was 100% ALL Bill's doing! He KNOWS how to talk and work with judges and prosecutors. I have a 100% clean record before and now thanks to Bill, I continue to. I have never been that person "in trouble" with the law. I couldn't believe I found myself in a situation where I was in trouble due to accusations of another. This situation cause me SO much stress and anxiety, Bill will treat you like family, he answered my texts even when late at night when I was worried about my case. Whether you are guilty or innocent, I 100% KNOW Bill will be your best chance at the best outcome for your case.

I'm just one of your averaged day Joe's. American Patriot that lives Downriver. One day 13. 2 thousand volts went through me off the job while I was fixing an antenna in my backyard. It took me out ten times. I was in the hospital recovering for 4 months. Wallin Detroit Metro Burn Unit, I was in a coma for a month and had to do over 15 surgeries. After them surgeries begin to heal, I had to learn how to walk again. With Detroit Receiving being part of DMC. They sent me to the other part call Rim. Rim means Rehabilitation Institute of Michigan. I heard learn how to walk again. It was a living hell as huel Perkins said on Fox 2 Detroit when they did my interview. Months later while still recovering, I met Bill Clovis.This attorney my brother retained for a DUI. He did a fine job for my brother's legal problem. My brother told him about me. Then Bill took an interest in my case and he asked me if he could pursue this case. I thought about it for a while. Then I called him up, met him face-to-face and I knew that he would be the one. 18 months later, this man used by God because of his awesome talents with the law, got me the full umbrella of my case. He's one of the best attorneys I've ever seen that pulled these things off. He has the blessings of God on him. Bill will always have a winning blessing over him because of his good hurted nature. It would be foolish to run into him and not let him take your case. Especially if he looks you in the eye and told you, I got this! Because that's what he told me. Good job Bill. We're proud of you!

I was given very little time to retain  legal representation . Using the internet as my search toolI came across a legal site and submitted my inquiry . Bill responded  and his telephone conversation  convinced me he was the right guy.   I was lucky to have hired someone like Bill Colovos.  I was charged with a misdemeanor in a domestic violence case earlier this year, not a very serious charge but just the same it was very serious to me considering I haven't been in any trouble with the law since I was a very young man decades ago.     Bill put my mind at ease, and was able to get me through this maze and in the end a fair judgment. His 29 years experience and fairness are hallmark.  Thanks again Bill.

Not Guilty of OWI second offence; that is what Bill’s skill and hard work produced for me.  I had hired another attorney before I found Bill; he soaked me out of $5,000 dollars by telling me he was going to get me off because the police made all kinds of mistakes.When we had the pretrial the judge denied both of his motions and set a trial date.After seeing that attorney in court I knew I was in real trouble.  I told my story to several Attorneys and finally found one that actually listened and understood I really did have a defense.  When I hired Bill I already had a jury trial date set and I didn’t even have the police report from my other attorney.  Bill came to my house on 3 occasions and spent several hours going over all the details of my case.  He helped me get all the discovery reports and audio video evidence that the police might use.  He was honest with me from the very first about my chances of winning and my options; the other attorney had just been lying to me to get my money.  My wife has a mental medical condition and had snapped around bedtime; I had to drive my car to keep her from hurting her self or me.  The police contacted me by cell phone and ordered me to drive back supposedly for my side of the story.  When I pulled up they had already made up their mind to arrest me for OWI.  Bill found the breath machine they used on me was pulled out of service 2 weeks later.  According to the police I was acting drunk flunked the sobriety test and after blowing 3 times in their Breathalyzer they finally got a reading of .11.  When we heard the audio of the arrest Bill was honest with me that my chances at trial were not as good as we first thought.  Bill was able to get the prosecutor to offer me a reckless non-driving deal but I had been through probation before and didn’t want to go through that again.  Bill spent hours with me putting together a strategy to hopefully keep the tape from being shown during the trial.  At the trial the police denied ordering me to drive and Bill successfully discredited the officer and proved him to be a liar.  He also raised plenty of doubt about the procedures that they used to prosecute me.  Bottom line was a not guilty verdict even with a Breathalyzer of .11 and a police officer swearing he knows a drunk driver when he sees one.  If you are in trouble and want to hear the truth and get the hours of work you are paying for I highly recommend Bill Colovos.  He wont charge you for a trial prep then tell you this is the best deal you can get.  He has a win rate of 97% but that fact alone will get you the best deal from the prosecutor if they really got you.  Let Bill take a look at your case; he can tell you if you have a chance at trial or if you should be looking for the best deal you can get.

Mr Colovos  is a excellent Attorney. He was very understanding of the situation i was in. He explained everything in detail and was very patient with all the questions we had. Also his fee's are very reasonable and did not charge us a fortune like other attorneys I called before I spoke to Mr Colovos. Myself and my Family are very appreciative of the help he provided for us and would recommend him to anyone we know.

Mr. Alyan is an amazing lawyer and counsel. My son is a teenager and he got in a motorcycle accident due to stop and go traffic. When we first talked to Mr. Alyan he took personal interest in my son and personally spoke to him to make sure he was ok. He also went to bat for us in court and was able to get the ticket dismissed with no fine or points. Mr. Alyan's professionalism is second to non. I récompenses him very highly to anyone that is looking for someone to fight hard for your rights. Lawyer like Mr. Alyan are a credit to this profession. Thank you Chris, you are the best!

Managing partner of Boc Law Group, P.C. William R. Orlow, set out to do what he told me he would do and I as a client was very pleased. It started that my bank account was frozen by my creditors. I called Orlow and set up an appointment. He immediately got my account unfrozen. Within a few months my bankruptcy was finished. I was clear of my debts and now have a new financial beginning.His staff and himself were very professional and kind. All he needed to hear was just the facts, and they took care of it with precision accuracy. Thank you very much Boc Law Group. Your client Steve P.

I would like folks to know that both Bill Orlow and Jason Cardasis have handled my case(s) in a very professional yet friendly manner.  At certain moments when I was terrified at the changes that life was throwing at me, I was always assured that I was in good hands.  In the end - the outcome was nothing less than astonishing!!  Now that I am a knowledgeable consumer, I would have gladly have paid ten times the legal fees I have paid this firm for the peace of mind and a staff that really cares when questions inevitably pop up.

I usually don't leave reviews for things like this, but when I saw this, I had to leave a review for Nicole. She was my attorney for a murder trial a few years ago. I was 100% innocent and Nicole was able to see that immediately from me. She worked so hard and so passionately and was able to finally return me home to my family after 6 months of sitting in jail waiting for trial. She was the female version of Matlock in the court room. My life is forever in debt to her! Thank you Nicole! I love you for what you have done for me!!

Not only did the attorney exemplify professionalism with our case, but also were caring and understanding about our financial predicament when the case was brought. Charfoos &amp; Christensen got us the legal help we needed as well as showing a level of empathy that our family was not used to when dealing with attorneys. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Surfing web looking for attorneys after my 4 partners and I were in a accident, happened to run across this free resource hotline.  1 phone call to them and they helped us all. They were truly there for us every step of the way. They walked 3 of us through our claims process, sent me to a shop who repaired my car for cheap and they set us all up with top notch attorneys. 2 of my buddies didn't have Dr's, they took care of that also. 5 THUMBS UP, I WILL FOREVER BE GREATFUL

This company is awesome. I had been looking for some help for my auto accident for over 6 months and was running outta confidence. I never been in a accident and didn't know anything about claims and dealing with insurance adjusters and all that stuff so i called Injury Advocates after reading your review. Must admit this company was A1 and they didn't waste any time getting me a ton of free resources and I was immediately assigned a personal advocate (I love this service). Man this lady is like my personal assistant. She is so darn knowledgeable, witty and aggresive with my insurance company they have completely changed their tune and has approved me for 3 different types of payments that I didn't even know I was suppose to be getting until she stepped in. Much love for the posting.

My family and I were involved in an auto accident and oh my God we were so lost. Each attorney we called were only concerned with us starting a lawsuit and not getting us any help with our injuries. A girl at our Dr. office called and told us about this company, we called and I swear, God has truly sent his angels our way. This company assigned us to a PERSONAL ADVOCATE, someone we can call 24/7 and the level of professionalism, I didn't think it existed. They have assisted us with every aspect of our accident from claims to good medical help to transportation and a wonderful attorney. GOD BLESS INJURY ADVOCATES and BEST OF ALL - THERE SERVICES ARE 100% FREE.

I would like to first say on behalf of my whole family, thank you. You delivered on everything you promised and really came through for my family. It's rare in today's age that a lawyer really does what they promise they are going to do. You really helped me and went above and beyond to prove my innocence. Myself and my family are really grateful for all your hard work on this case. Please tell your family and clients how grateful we are for all the hard work you did on my case. It really hurts my family so much that these false allegations going for years. It's a pain that I have never felt before. But one thing that comforts me is that I know you got me a work that almost no other lawyer would have been able to do. I now truly understand what you meant by that. It was so hard and painful to go through this experience but you made it wishful and prayful as you always used to tell me and more than that was that you believed that I was innocent. It would have really hurt my whole family on a level I don't want to imagine. Thank you for protecting not only my self from that but my family as well. I would also like to really thank you for sticking with my family and this case. I know it was not easy. But you stuck with us and got us the best verdict which was the wish of all my family :not guilty on all the 19 countas and for that I will always be grateful.

Mr. Peter Tochman is a highly competent lawyer. I was referred to him in a collections matter by the Oakland lawyer referral services. I also retained him as our lawyer to close our probate estate case. We had a very difficult case and our previous attorney could only go so far on it, and then fastidious, hardworking, great attorney Peter took it over giving us tremendous relief, and hope. He knows what he is doing. He is brilliant, kind, a very good man. God bless him and his family.

I was referred to Pete by a real estate agent and was very glad to have found him.  I called and he spent a considerable amount of time with me laying out some options and important factors – all for no fee.  I then decided to hire him to proceed with my case.  Using both email and phone calls he was very responsive and thoroughly knowledgeable in real estate law. This was the first time I needed to hire a lawyer and Pete walked me through the entire process by laying out potential courses the actions may or may not follow.   I would not hesitate to recommend Pete to anyone.

So thankful to have him on my side!  He told me exactly what to expect in my case.  I couldn't believe everyone who knew him downtown at the courthouses!  As soon as I seen the respect he has by fellow attorneys and the judges/referees,  I knew I was in good hands.  I've read all of the review on here and I'm downright flabbergasted because I didn't find him rude or unprofessional at all.  He's to the point. You may not like what he has to say but he says what needs to be said and he really guided me into becoming a better parent for my child.  He's been in practice a long time and he knows what he's doing and he did a great job for me.  My ex even tried to hire him after our case was over because he was so impressed with his work!  Sorry that didn't work out for my ex. LOL  In the end, we both put our feelings aside and we learned how to co-parent. Our child is healthy both physically and emotionally.  I'm truly grateful for Mr. Brand and all the hard work he did for me.  There's not many attorneys out there like him.

I met with Chris after I had phone consultation with another attorney who had received several favorable reviews on YELLOWPAGES. When I spoke to the 'other' attorney I felt he wasn't the right fit for me. Thankfully I decided to call Chris from the Bankruptcy Management Group because I immediately felt comfortable with him.  Chris has a relaxed and friendly demeanor which is helpful for someone like me who is in a stressful situation. He saw me right away and set my mind at ease with my financial situation. I highly recommend Chris Frank to anyone who's looking for an expert in the area of bankruptcy and is a pleasure to work with!

Mr. David Roby is an excellent lawyer, and I can’t recommend his services enough. Here are just a few traits that made me extremely happy with his representation:1) He knew the judicial system front to back. His years of experience have allowed him to gain a high level of understanding on how things work in the courts. This led to a very satisfactory resolution to my legal concern.2) He always explained the process in an easy to understand fashion. I felt like he wanted to ensure that I knew what was going on at every step.3) Finally, Mr. Roby was always reachable. If I had a question I could reach out via phone, email, and even text message. I always got a follow-up.I highly recommend Mr. Roby for your legal needs!

David Roby was assigned my my Fiances case through appointment because we could not afford a lawyer. From Day one Mr. Roby was always there for him and the family doing what ever he could with in the law to try and get him home. Thanks to Mr. Roby my Fiance will be home soon soon after two long months of him being gone. Mr. Roby was always honest and always told us everything that could happen to him including the worst of 7 or more years. He never promised anything but always assured us that he would do his best. That is what I look for in a lawyer.

Great place to see a movie, except they don't change bulbs in the projectors nearly enough. Screen one is very dark no detail in dark scenes at all, and Screen three has a bad transmitter that they never change. Sound clips on screen 3 and static prone high notes and lows come out very poorly.

I like the concept of a drive in theatre.  I wish there were move in Michigan.  I enjoyed the movies that we saw.  I noticed the concession stand has been updated since my last visit.  I wish the lot was updated.  There's gravel in certain locations.  Perhaps they should invest in concreate throughout the entire theatre.

I think that the drive in is great. My kids and I look forward to go their every summer. My husband has never been to one until I took him there last year and now he likes to go ever summer. I love the fact that you can get two movies for the price of one. Plus the price is great, even the one on Wyoming when ou can get the kids in for free before a certain time. So keep it up!!!!!!!!!

I have been going to Taylor Made for approx 18 yrs now & will not go anywhere else. All three of my dogs, whom I’ve taken there over the years come home looking fabulous & most importantly they are happy!!! I would absolutely recommend Saundra or Renee if you’re looking for a groomer to treat your furry child very well!!!

I would highly recommend this shop!  The girls are friendly and professional and definite animals lovers.....my dog di not want to leave!   They do great work, you can see everything that is going on, and all the dogs that were on the tables were being so good!  I asked if all dogs sat so good and the reply was yes for the most part.  I guess these ladies really know how to handle the dogs.  My dog looks beautiful and smells so good!  They even put a halloween bandana on her.....how cute!  Don't go anywhere else!!  I love this place!  This was my third visit and I made my next appointment before I left.

I have been taking my dogs to Sandy since 2005 when I meet my wife and moved to the Detroit area (my wife took her dog to Sandy before I met her).  I can see why she chose Tailor Made Grooming and Sandy's business.   Sandy offers a GREAT service for a GREAT price.  We always tip her extra, except when I paid by credit card this time and did not have any cash, but I will definitely tip her double next time!!  :)

The girls at Tailor Made take care of my pup while making her look great at a very affordable price!! I would reccomend them to anyone with a dog who isn't sure where to get their pet groomed!!

I believe this is just one of the buisneses that care, not only for your dogs but also for the struggling economy. They offer low prices, and trim nails for free, and even go as far as trimming my dogs face in between groomings for no charge. I appreciate this service imensly and so does my dog. It's so good to know their are people out there who care and love the dogs that come to see them, the girls at Tailor Made Grooming are terrific, they love their clients and are not here to drain you for your money. I would recommend this place to everyone i know.

I am VERY happy with this grooming shop!  I have a shitzu and took him to Petsmart for grooming and was extremely displeased with how my dog looked, acted, smelled...etc.  They tranquilized my dog and he was so drugged up when he got home it was terriable.  They said they had to do it incase he tried to bite....The girls here at this shop are very friendly and they do not tranquilize here.  They said my dog was great and they would love for him to come back!  And we will be back.  They even put a bandanna around his neck and that was cute.  He has a sore on his paw that I did not notice and the groomer told me about it so I could keep an eye on it.I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that loves their dog.  These girls truely love what they do!!

I've been taking my dog here for years. Never once have I been dis-satisfied. I'm very pleased with the work they do. Many of my friends take their dogs here to. They have been to other groomers and we're never pleased. They really treat every dog like their own.They even take my dog for a walk when they have to potty. Their are 3 absolute wonderful women who groom. Hands down, Tailor Made Grooming is the best.

My search is over looking for groomers that do a great job and treat my dogs well.  Shelly and Tonya are friendly and the shop is cute and clean.  The last groomer said my cocker was emotional and these ladies have no qualms with him.  They do a fantastic brush out on my chow/retriever too.

They are absolutely great!  I have three dogs and I know our "Bennie" is tough when it comes to getting groomed - the girls were friendly and he seemed very happy - he did not seem like he was stressed out (like he is when I took him to other places) - he was very calm when I got him home and they did an absolutely wonderful job!I will be bringing my other two dogs here too!  Love to support my neighborhood small businesses!  Very cute and clean place!

Stonehill is the place to go if you're looking for a great family companion. Their shepherds are bred with temperament as a priority and it shows when you meet their dogs. If you're looking for a healthy, sound, intelligent AND BEAUTIFUL dog, I highly recommend Stonehill kennels.

I first boarded my puppy here on recommendations from a friend. Had excellent experience. I than enrolled him in the 2 week train and board and could not be happier with the results. We attend the socials and are amazed to see all the German Shepards interacting. So extremely happy with all of their services.

My Stonehill dog saved my life! I bought an awesome dog from Stonehill with the intention of her just being a great companion for my husband and I. One day I was having some slight chest pains. I didn't think anything of it until our dog started acting odd and wouldn't leave my side. I took the hint and went to the hospital. Turns out I was having a heart attack, and my dog sensed it. We took her to special training and she is now a certified cardiac detection dog. She alerted on not only me, but my husband as well. She saved both our lives and we can't thank her enough! Thank you for producing our hero Stonehill.

Best dog ever! After a long wait on their waiting list, I finally got a puppy from Stonehill Kennels. They asked me what I was looking for in great detail and told me they would call me when they had the perfect match. Boy were they not kidding! It took a few months, but was well worth the wait! The litter I chose from was everything I wanted color, size and temperament wise. I couldn't decide which one I wanted, but Shelly was so helpful and told me about each puppy in detail. She really knows her dogs and after hours of debating with myself(while Shelly waited with the patience of a saint), I finally picked my dream puppy! He's a year old now, and everything I could have ever wanted in a dog.. and so much more! My friend was on their waiting list at the same time as me, but wasn't patient enough to wait for the perfect match. I went with him to the kennel he got his dog, and boy, Stonehill easily outshines them! These other dogs were small, hyped up, ugly and fearful, the breeder wasn't helpful at all. Stonehill dogs are the complete opposite, and so was Shelly! My friend's dog is older than mine, and is only half the size, and is a total nutjob. He learned his lesson the hard way and will be going to Stonehill next time, as will I!

Stonehill is the best! The dogs are amazing, and so are the people. I first found them when they visited a family member with their amazing therapy dogs. These people take out the time to do little things like that, and that's what matters most! Anyway, I got a Stonehill boy (after lots of interviewing by this amazing breeder) and he is the best dog I've ever had. Got his hips checked, they're perfect. He's healthy as a horse. He's super smart and has an amazing personality too! Everyone that meets him loves him and we get complimented on him everywhere we go. We're training him to be a therapy dog. Shelly has helped us with that, and has gone above and beyond what was necessary to help us and answer our questions. If you have any complaints about your dog, we must not have gone to the same place! There is nothing to complain about when it comes to this kennel. Stonehill is German shepherd heaven, and I will never get a dog from anyone besides Shelly and the Stonehill gang!

Without a doubt the best breeder I have seen. My GSD will be 2 in July and he has the best demeanor I have ever seen in a German shepherd, he has not even been neutered yet, and he has never shown any aggression or any sign of being territorial to where I would even think about doing it. Every vet who has seen him is so impressed with how well behaved he is, and everyone who lays eyes on him falls in love.The way Stonehill treats their puppies and gets them use to being groomed is impressive, I have never had trouble with grooming, he doesn't mind his nails being clipped or getting a bath. I am very impressed with them and recommend them to everyone looking for a GSD.

I bought my first GSD from Shelly and she was a wonderful dog, her learning and training ability was amazing. She was the best dog we could ever ask for! We are now waiting to get another female from Stone Hill in eight weeks and all are so excited! Shelly is a #1 breeder who cares deeply for her German Shepherds and they don't know how lucky they are!

Dr. Sharma and his staff at Blue Cross are such caring and wonderful people. Dr. Sharma goes the extra mile in research to stay current and to diagnose the cause of your animal's illness. He saved my dog's life when it looked hopeless by refusing to give up and finally finding an answer.  His staff is very knowledgeable and patient.  I thoroughly recommend Blue Cross Animal Hospital.

I will always bring my animals to Amazon animal clinic. My husband and I discovered one of our cats was urinating blood. My husband worked 12 hours that day (7am-7pm) and my mother was in the hospital, so he was looking into 24 hour places to take Moomoo (my cat) when he got off work. Those places wanted 75$ just to walk in the door! My husband called amazon around 730pm just to see if they were still there and the vet drove from his house to meet my husband with our cat. He is so compassionate. He will always have our business.

I took my two cats to Amazing Animal Clinic for the last 4 years and I am happy with Dr.Matthews service. His clinic is clean, not a long wait, and good friendly service. They give me an estimate before they do anything. For my cat to be stayed I called other clinics and all wanted a feline leukemia test and stool test in order to do surgery. But Dr. Mathew only recommened these things, he did not force me to do them in order to spay or nueter my cats. Dr. Mathew I do not agree with these two posts. It seems like one of your past receptionist might be posting thse. I would suggest you try to find out the origin of these posts and take legal action against this habitual LIAR.

I use Dr. Mathew at the Amazon Animal Clinic for my 4 cats & 1 dog. He is very friendly, knowlegable & his facility is clean. This clinic is always willing to see your pet even after hours or on a short notice. His prices are reasonable! If you are looking for a new place to try, try the Amazon Animal Clinic. I highly recommend.

This little gem of a pet store is family owned and operated.  All of the employees are friendly, helpful and knowledgeable of the products they offer.  The back of the store has little animals like rabbits and lizards and fish.  The kids love to go in there and see them like a little trip to the zoo.  Give them a try...you won't be disappointed!

This is the nicest grooming facility I've ever used. The owner is extremely pleasant and totally hands on. Her cuts are wonderful. It's also a great environment for the dog. No stuffing your pet in a crate. They get to play. Appointment times are well planned and and are not overly long. Your dog will be happy and relaxed when you pick it up. After 35 years of dealing with grooming facilities this is the very best. They truly care about your four legged friend.

I was so pleased to find Grooming with Love. This place is immaculate - so clean, no smell and I felt I made the right choice for my puppy's first grooming experience. I must admit, as a new dog owner, I took my puppy there not knowing what to expect - like if he needed a bath, trim or full groom. I told the owner, Tina Taylor, that i will leave to her as the professional to do what is necessary. Well I never dreamed a 'rescue mutt' would need a full grooming / hair cut. I thought that was for poodles, schnauzers etc. Well my puppy looked amazing and I was so pleased that I put my trust in her. Secondly, another great sign, my dog loves her and wagged his tail and gave kisses good bye. He did not freak out when I took him back a second time. That says a lot. I wish i could show you a before and after photo. For only $45 he got bathed, wonderful hair cut, had his glands done, nails, ear hair - the works. If you are particular about who handles your pet, don't hesitate to go the Grooming With Love. I don't think she has a website, but i saw her place on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/pages/Grooming-with-Love/355647444453934.

This is the best veterinarian facility downriver!  Everybody there is professional, friendly and make you feel like you're a family member.  They knew how much I loved my cat and when the time came to say good-bye, Dr. Crawshaw and his staff made it a little easier to do what was best for my Tigger Lee.  When I get another pet, I will be taking him or her here.

I cannot express enough what a WONDERFUL place The Greenfield Animal Hospital is, and I would HIGHLY recommend them to any pet owners for all your pet care needs.We recently had to put our 16 year old poodle to sleep, and they are BY FAR the nicest place we could have taken our Little Lacy Girl.From the receptionists, to the technicians, to the doctors (Dr. Jennifer Zerbel) they all went above and beyond our expectations. The room where we said goodbye was such a peaceful place, the staff kept us informed and explained everything about the process, they encouraged us to ask any questions that we had, and they compassionately allowed us to have as much time with her as we needed during each step of the way.They have genuine sympathy for pets and their owners, and they truly treated our dog as if she were their own.Additionally, a few days after we said goodbye to our dog Lacy, we received a hand written card with deepest sympathy from Dr. Zerbel, as well as a beautiful clay disk of Lacy's paw print, which included her name and some really pretty jewels.They really took great care of her and were so kind... and the consideration they showed during each step of the process, really helped to make it that much easier for our entire family. We are so very pleased with The Greenfield Animal Hospital... They are truly an A+ Veterinary Hospital!!

My horse trailer was totaled by a guy running of the road and hitting the trailer while parked in my driveway. The insurance company had an appraisal done I wasn't happy with and they said I was welcome to have a second appraisal done if I paid for it. It was well worth it!!

Riggi Insurance helped me to get the best price for my auto insurance and my homeowners.  I called many places and no one helped me like these guys did.  They went through many companies and found me the cheapest one.  These guys were very friendly and treated me the way a customer should be treated.  I would tell anyone who needs insurance to go directly to Riggi & Associates, I know I will never bother with the hassle of other companies.  I will always use Riggi & Associates!

We are very happy with Larry's professionalism with a wonderful twist of personal care in finding exactly what we wanted.  The tools & resources he provided to us were extremely helpful and his response time to our needs was exemplary. He took so much stress out of the process from the first day we met, to the day we closed.  The firm behind this agent is top notch as well.  Don't hesitate to contact and trust Larry to handle your real estate requirements, both purchasing and selling.  You will have no regrets.

Very great staff! Very great service. Very patient and helpful with the process of purchasing a home. My realtor Theresa very nice, very courteous, answered all questions in a very timely manner through text messages. I could call or text anytime with questions or comments. It's a process buying a house and my realtor guided me through every step and making it so much more relaxing. I recommend this Realty to anyone trying to purchase a home or sell a home.

The staff at Source Realty was very professional and courteous. This was my first home purchase and I was lost. My Realtor Helen was very knowledgeable and answered the million questions I had throughout the transaction. I would highly recommend this office to anyone in need of a home. They truly put your mind at ease. Helen, I can't thank you enough...you were wonderful as were the girls on your office staff.  To everyone at Source a big THANK YOU for making this transition as easy as it could possibly be!!!!

The office staff is truly UNPROFESSIONAL, RUDE and DISRESPECTFUL. They will  try to talk to you anyway they choose to and then everyone else in the office is in the background chiming in. It's obvious these women have no real office/professional skills or training. (I see why the front door glass is always cracked or broken) The owner/owners of this business need to clean house.

I like renting with them. I like that they have a pyhysical office I can go to. Is a bigger company so you dont have to hunt down your landlord to get somethign done.

My house switched from a single person landlord to with Rondo Investment a few years ago. Its much better renting with a large company than with a single landlord, and I dont have to wait days to get a hold of someone because they are out of town or something. Their plumber Tom is also really fast and comes out usually a day or two after I call.

Rondo is the only property manager in town worth dealing with!  I am renting a house that switched over to their management, and they are finally getting issues I have been reporting for a long time taken care of.  So happy to be dealing with a company that is responsive to problems I have.

Taking money for applications  knowing that the home is not available  say the house twice second time was told it had a bed big problem  and the workers were scared to finish the property  called to ask about the home said it was leased  already why take my 50$ if the home wasn't available

The staff is friendly but not reliable when it comes to fixing/replacing what needs to be done in your home after you move in. They "take note" of your order then do not call you back. Half the time they don't even answer the phone. If I were to rent again, I wouldn't go back to them.

I have seen the property management onsite for years.  They meet with vendors to cure any concerns.  When I had some concrete concerns, I could see them out onsite meeting with contractors.  I think they do a fine job

KC Property Services is hands down the worst organization I've ever had to deal with - property management or otherwise.Their customer service is terrible.  Emails routinely go unanswered and phone call after phone call typically accomplishes nothing.Their method for resolving issues, written letter only, is ridiculous and a tremendous waste of time.On top of that, they frequently send late fee notices that are incorrect and which require multiple steps to correct.I could go on and on but whatever you do, DON'T hire KC Property Services.  If 0 stars was an option, I'd choose it.

Our community hired KCPS two years ago after having a large property management company.  We are very happy with the "personal service" from the owner of the company and the staff.  We really like having a live person that answers the phone when we call the office, we do not get an answering machine.  We highly recommend this company to manage condominiums.

I've stored at the Ann Arbor location for a few years now and ever since Kathy took over I've had a great experience. She's very professional and the one time I had a problem she took care of it immediately. I'm not sure what Brian W. is talking about, but when my friends need storage I tell them to go see Kathy.

I’ve rented from the Ann Arbor location for sixteen months and had an emergency today due to having my wallet stolen.  I live over fifty miles away from the Ann Arbor location but drove during the winter storm because of the urgency to protect my identity and money and search for some documentation I could use to begin replacing all of my I.D.s and bank cards.  When I attempted to open my storage unit the door was jammed and would not slide open.  I went to the office and saw the office is closed on Sundays.  I decided to knock on the door just in case someone might be able to help me open my unit’s door.  A man opened the door and I explained to him the situation and was offered a cold and unconcerned response.  He told me the office was closed and I’d have to come back on Monday.  I left to drive back home without receiving access to the storage unit that I have paid for.  The snow storm is expected to get worse so I likely will not be able to drive back to the Ann Arbor location Monday further delaying my ability to protect my identity and money.  While your employee was under no obligation to be a helpful person his response and lack of willingness to be flexible and help me get access to my unit due to equipment problems during such a difficult situation leaves me wanting to end my relationship with Stop-N-Lock Storage at the end of the current rental month.  Additionally, the rental fee should include the ability to get access to my unit while the gates are open.  I understand sometimes equipment doesn’t work as we expect yet a little flexibility in an emergency would help go a long way in letting your customers know they matter to Stop-N-Lock. Thank you for your time,Unit #1016politicalwolverine@gmail.com

Hired John to do a short notice inspection.  This was against my better judgement because I read a review that said he never returns calls and is not timely on returning report.  When I told him about the review he said it was because he was in the hospital.  Anyway, he came out and did a thorough inspection.  He said he would have the report to me within 24 hours or it would be free (which never happened) and I emphasized how important it was because we were trying to close within that same week.  He also stated for me to contact him if I needed a pest inspection report that is required by the VA and he would send me one (I attempted to contact him and never heard back).  So, after the inspection it took him almost 5 days to return the inspection report.  In the meantime, I tried calling, left voicemails, texted and even emailed him with no returned calls, emails, nothing.  I also had to hire another person to come and do the pest inspection because he never delivered as promised.  We ended up not closing on time because of him but the sellers were gracious thank goodness.  AVOID WASTING YOUR TIME AND MONEY with Home Inspector John, LLC!!!
 -

Inspector John showed up 30 minutes early to walk the two story roof prior to walking me around the outside and inside of both my garage and home.  His attention to detail, depth of knowledge and overall professionalism has to be on par or above anyone else in his profession.  His report and feedback was thorough with a fast turn-around (approximately 24 hours).  I highly recommend him for home inspections, especially if you want someone who will take the time (3-4 hours) to walk through every detail as well as walk a roof that is higher than one story.

Took money, never provided inspection report.  Was stuck without inspection and no time to do anything about it.  Never returned phone calls, texts or emails once he got the money... 100% scam, BEWARE!!!
 -

We had a great overall experience.  So glad we attended the inspection as my wife and I learned so much and that made the report just a reminder of what we had already learned.  John is a true professional and we were glad that our agent recommended him.

Hands down this is the best law firm that I've used. Ms. Mathis and Mr. Carpenter was very helpful throughout the entire case. I mainly was assisted by Ms. Mathis and she was great. Any time I had a question or concern she gave me a clear explanation. Response times were phenomenal. I've never had to sit and wonder if they received my email message or phone call. I'm  still amazed at the service and outcome of my case. I know 5 stars are the max that you can rate  a company but they truly deserve 10+ stars. Thank you again for providing excellent service. I will definitely refer any of my friends/family that's in need of legal assistance to your firm. Continue the great work and I hope you all continue to thrive.

Used these guys to help me with my offer in compromise. They filed tax returns and reduced my back tax debt. I am now in great shape and saved thousands.
 -

First I would like to say that I am completely at fault for falling so far in my back-taxes. I was w-2 then 11 years ago switched to 1099. Needless to say, I couldnt afford my taxes due. I waited and waited but was never able to catch up. One day I was hit with a bank levy and wage garnishment. I called Anderson Bradshaw Conusltants because enough was enough. They stopped the garnishment within two days. It took longer(of course) to completely fix my tax mess, but they did. Completely honest and worth it. definite recommend!!

I am a truck driver and have been for 25 years. For the past 10 years I went without filing my taxes. I have back taxes, a levy, A bank Levy, And my wages were about to be garnished. I called Anderson Bradshaw consultants and within seven hours they stopped my bank levy. And released my wage garnishment. I am on the road to being settled with the IRS and state taxes. Also, I can go back to work without any worry.

I didn't get what I thought I would get when I paid for my daughter's tax case to be handled by this group. She ended up paying as much as she would if we had just done it ourselves. I should have just kept the $3000 I spent with them. Didn't meet expectations they set up front. Not a good experience.

I was a bit nervous at first trusting a company I found online to help me with taxes, but John immediately put me at ease. I owed over $75,000 to the IRS and had a number of missing tax returns and the IRS had already put a wage garnishment on my pay and had just hit my bank account for a sizable chunk of change. Within 24 hours of signing up John put me in touch with an ABC Attorney who got me my money back from the IRS and stopped the wage garnishment. I was kept informed throughout the process and every step was explained to me to make sure I knew what was happening. At the end, I only ended up having to pay the IRS $2,500. I cannot recommend Anderson Bradshaw enough.

I had not filed for 13 years!!!!! I decided to get married so I had to file but didn't have any w-2's or payroll tax information or deductions. Anderson Bradshaw took care of all of that for me. Now I am all caught up on my taxes and it feels great. I didn't even have to do a thing.

I came to Anderson Bradshaw with a $36,000 tax liability. After speaking with Mr. King, he put me in good hands with Josh Kronick. He immediately protected me from IRS Collection action, informed me every step of the way for what to expect from the process, and ultimately delivered me an Offer-in-Compromise that settled my tax burden for $500. I cannot recommend this firm enough. They gave me a fresh lease on life. Thank you!

When we received a letter from the IRS saying my daughter owed them over $18,000 for income in 2013, we nearly had heart attacks! Her U.S. income in that year was only around $5,000, because that was the year she started teaching in Asia. Calls to the IRS gleaned only a little information, but it appeared that an ex of hers had accessed her PayPal account, sold his products online, but not forwarded the information to her nor did he tell her about it. I found Anderson Bradshaw online, contacted them, and after working with Josh and Ted for a short period, they managed to get it all cleared up and proper paperwork filed to clear her of all liabilities. We could not have done it without their help, and I will be eternally appreciative.

I am a United States Navy Veteran, who recently found himself in hot water with IRS . They wanted all these old returns and W-2' s that I haven't seen in years . I called around for help but the tax preparers could only go back 2 years. The other tax firms wouldn't return my call. It was only when I contacted Anderson Bradshaw and spoke to Ted England that I was finally able to get the help that I needed. I am not some rich guy or some huge company ; however, Ted was willing to take the time to get my issue resolved. Thanks to Anderson Bradshaw Tax Consultants I am finally able to get my life back from the IRS.

I was paying the IRS $400 a month for 2 years and I was getting NO WHERE!  When I initially set it up I didn't realize how much they charged for penalties and interest.  It's down right criminal (but that's whole different story) Last summer, things got pretty tough for my wife and I, we were robbing Peter to pay Paul and we just couldn't keep up with the payment any longer.  I had spoke with a few companies a couple years back when all of this started, but they didn't seem like they could offer too much help.  Thankfully I found Anderson Bradshaw through YP and I'm really happy that I did!  I spoke with Ted, he was very patient and answered all of my questions through out the consultation. He explained our options and mapped out a step by step outline of how they were going to resolve our case. There's finally a light at the end of the tunnel for us and they saved us quite a bit of money in the end.  Thank so much for ending this nightmare & getting us that Fresh Start you promised

When I began my search for a tax attorney, it was my understanding  "serve this area" would have been completed in the state I resided.  My paperwork made it across the country from Los Angeles, California to Baltimore, Maryland.  The same paperwork had to be submitted twice, one for each office.   I would have felt more comfortable if the paperwork could have been handled once.   I know that I would have felt more confident  if I could have worked with the same person the whole way through the process.
 -

I cannot recommend ANDERSON BRADSHAW highly enough. There is always a courteous person to answer my questions and I personally work with Bill Davis most all the time. He has dealt with all my inept questions and queries. My account is not completely settled but is moving right along and the results are definitely are meeting my approval! My husband and I had ourselves in a real mess and they are getting things worked out really well. If you have any doubts about this company...don't hesitate to HIRE THEM ASAP!

I'm happy to write this review. I called ABC Tax two months ago when the IRS put a lien on my home and levied my wages. I was in $85,000 in debt to the IRS from when I started my own business many years ago. I never made any money in that business and now the IRS is threatening to take everything I have. As soon as I was transferred to Jeff, he put my mind at ease.  He is very knowledgable about tax help and tax resolution. He told me that he can stop the levy that day. and that I could settle my tax bill for only 5k. You guys did what you promised and now that I am paying back my reduced amount, The irs is removing the lien on my home and now I have a fresh start.
 -

These guys got the lien removed on my bank account in one day, and set up payments to the IRS that I could afford. Thanks, A-B!

My wife works as independent contractor and we got careless about quarterly deposits so after about 2 years we owed way too much. We looked around and this guy calmed us down and was able to get us some kind of compromise with the IRS  and payments that we can now afford. yes, we recommend them.

A tax preparer whom I have worked with for years turned out to be stealing from me. Michelle Moya Pearl stole my stimulus money, opened fraudulent accounts using my identity, and screwed me on my latest tax return when I began connecting the dots. Absolutely scandalous, this company is well aware of her wrong doings. Don't trust these people with your information or money.

Being legally bound to financial jargons all my life, I faced some tax evasion issues last year where I was going to be rendered superfluous by the court if they had acquitted me. Even though I was right in my own terms, with the help of OMG Tax, they efficiently discovered the fissures in the data I kept. It was truly an astounding experience.

Our office orders from Waiters On Wheels for every lunch meeting, which is about once or twice a week. We have a house account so that we get invoiced monthly instead of running up a corporate card.

I have found Marcello's Pizza to be the best pizza in town and the most like the finest New York pizza. The crust is delicious, and there is just the right balance of cheese and excellent tomato sauce. And they deliver!

If you haven't had a slice from Marcellos, you haven't really lived yet. From the moment you walk into this quaint yet qwerky establishment you'll know you have found something special. Maybe its the fact that this little jewel is located in the free thinking castro that gives it the mystique. Or maybe just maybe its the perfect crust with just the right amount of fresh toppings, you decide. For me its the ability to walk in at just about any time of the day and late into the evening and find something new and exciting in there choices. So if you want to try some of the best this city has to offer look no further!!!!! You have found what your taste has been looking for.

Our furnace failed to kick in with the first cool weather of the year; replacing the thermostat had no effect so I called ANPH. Our service person was Nathan. After diagnosing the problem as failed computer board, he immediately arranged to have a new one delivered to the company office the next morning, so he could return to install it (so we would have heat for the weekend). His explanation of the problem was clear and helpful. He was quite thorough -- it took over two hours to do the installation and confirm the new part and our furnace in general was working correctly. I also found it nice that he wore paper booties upon entering our house so no dirt from outside was tracked in. Nathan was a pleasure to have working in our home.

Extremely fair and credible plumbing company!  They are prompt and stand by their estimates even when they encounter unforeseen difficulties AND they keep their customers appraised all along the way of the progress they are making.  They clean up very well after themselves and are very pleasant to work with in every way!  Gustavo was very clear on all the work they were doing and both gentlemen were a pleasure to work with.  Excellent Company to do business with and obviously genuinely CARE about their customers... always will get my repeat business!!

Quick, painless, and reasonable price.  I had what I thought was a small leak in the crawl space under my house but it turned out the entire cast iron sewer line needed to be replaced.  Yes, really; I saw the corroded pipes (89 years old), which were all hauled away.  The replacement was ABS plastic, which I was told is more resistant to drain cleaners, etc.Rafi and Enrique did the work and got it done in a little short of a day.  They were careful, measuring the slope of each section of pipe to ensure proper drainage, and without being asked, positioned the new pipes to make it easier to access the crawl space in the future, securing them to foundation beams above.  They were cheerful and didn't mind me watching the work and taking pictures.  (It's a learning experience!)Kudos also to Albert Nahman Plumbing for accommodating my difficult schedule...

My wife's family was in town for a visit, when we noticed water pouring out of the garage. Argh, our water heater broke.  Perfect timing as usual! So, I signed up for an offer through one of these online services that recommend local plumbers, explaining that I would need work done right away. The result, flakes! I got 1 call back, 5 hours later, and the woman said they can't come out until the next day.I searched some more on the internet and found this company in San Francisco. The plumber was over in less than an hour, and within 3 hours, we were up and running again. Absolutely top notch!

I called Friendly Plumber first, but got an answering machine because I guess it was outside their business hours. I left a message, then proceeded to call the other supposed good plumbers here and one after another, I got answering machines. Companies who claim to be open 24 hours, 7 days a week, and I got the annoying beeping tones of answering machines.I guess I should have looked closely because someone else already ran into the same problem. It's really frustrating to me that apparently, plumbers don't answer phones anymore. I suppose things are that good. But I digress. At the stroke of 9:00 o'clock, I got a call back from Friendly Plumber. Wow, now that's professional. I told the receptionist that my sewer is backed up. She asked several questions about the problem and told me that it might be best to call this other rooter company who has the proper equipment, and personnel for that type of work.  I called that guy who promptly answered the phone, and finally, he was able to clear the clog before noon. I suppose I should have just waited for Friendly Plumber to open in the first place so that I didn't have to go through the run around. If I ever have another problem in the future, I know the one and only plumber I'll be calling.

This company is the best...they told me straight-up what was wrong and was honest, without pulling any punches.  I recently had two problems at my house.  One they couldn't fix because it was a stopped-up toilet.  They apparently do not do these, because I was told that I would actually get a better price from companies who specialize in stoppages.  They did refer me to another company who did charge me a good price, so they were right.  The second problem I had was that my water heater needed replacement.  This one was done in less than half a day, which was very impressive.  The plumber did an excellent job, was polite and gave my wife and I a lot of tips on what to do in case we run into problems in the future.  I will recommend this company to other people.  Good Job!!

I called because of my plugged up toilet and was told by the receptionist that their earliest availability in 1-1/2 weeks.  Argh!  She also said that I'd get faster response by calling a rooter type company because that's their specialty, plus they'll be CHEAPER too. Huh?  What?  Was that HONESTY I just heard?  She added that their plumbers are too skilled to do that kind of work, but rooter companies staff entry level technicians, which totally makes sense.I'm definitely calling them later this year for my bathroom remodel.  And give that receptionist a raise, Friendly Plumber.  She's alright.

I had Friendly Plumber install a sink that I bought from Ikea. It turned out that my sink was missing a few pieces. The plumber that came to our house was great. He supplied us with the missing parts without giving us a hard time. He was very professional and courteous.

I called this company because they were recommended by my neighbor who already used them. I am reviewing them because I was impressed by them. They were very friendly and professional over the phone, and came out right away to give me a quote. The price was pretty good and they were able to start right away.They installed a walk in bath for my disabled mother and she is very happy that she can now take a bath on her own.

I've been a Friendly Plumber customer for over seven years and I have always enjoyed very good service from this company.I'm in the middle of selling my second home in San Francisco, and it was part of the contingency agreement that I have things repaired before the sale could go through. Minor fixes of a leaky shower head, kitchen faucet replacement, and a wobbly toilet. Even though these things had to get done in a day and their schedule was already booked, Robert skipped lunch that day and ended-up working really, really late just to finish the project.This is the kind of professionalism that isn't always around anymore. I even tried to get other plumbers to come out and do the same job after hearing about Friendly Plumber's schedule, but no one would even bother to see the job when I told them that I needed it done the same day.I'm sticking with Robert and his crew. Their fantastic customer service is worth every penny!

I discovered this company through this site and what a GREAT find! The plumber got there when he said he would, and the price was I thought pretty fair considering this was 8:30am on a Saturday.My water heater was leaking water everywhere and since my husband was out of town, I thought I should just open my wallet and give all its contents to the first plumber who walks through my door. Any plumber, anybody!Shockingly, the plumber was courteous, professional, and even cleaned up the entire mess. He didn't have to do this, but I thought it was a nice touch. Good recommendation, fellow reviewers. Thanks for helping me avert what could have been a very ugly and expensive mess :)

I was referred to Friendly Plumber by my neighbor when my kitchen sink, bathtub and sewer backed up.  I called and found out that they don't work on stoppages, so that's what they mean by stoppage, but they did refer me to another rooter company who had really good customer service too.I did though use Friendly Plumber to put in a new sewer for my house.  I'm a relatively new homeowner, so it was important for me to be able to trust my contractor.  I got several bids for the job and was at first convinced that I should try to find a company who offers the pipe replacement without disturbing the ground.  After talking with Robert, he informed me that the city doesn't always allow that type of plumbing, it wouldn't be up to code and would never pass inspection.  Strange, the other plumber before him said that he does it all the time in the city and he highly recommends it.  I called the Department of Building Inspection's Plumbing Department to make sure because I really hate being on the fence with conflicting recommendations, but I was told with all authority that yes, in my area, that was definitely not allowed.  Can you believe this?  What if I went with that guy and in the end my job wouldn't pass?Anyway, I promptly called Friendly Plumber back and they were able to squeeze me into their schedule.  Robert re-routed the path of the pipes to avoid having to dig-up my ultra-cool espaliered apple tree, which I appreciate.  He was very professional throughout the entire process and I'm very thankful for my neighbor for the last minute recommendation.

So far, I've been very happy with this company.Robert has always come to my house ON TIME and has offerred solutions to my many, many a problem (yep, I'm restoring a Victorian) to sometimes from what I can tell more of a loss in business for him.I highly recommend Robert.

Friendly Plumber is great. Very professional.  The plumber showed up maybe 10 minutes early for the appointment and gave me a detailed written estimate on the spot. I wanted to have the job done immediately since my water heater was kaput, so the plumber called their office to order the heater and for more parts to additionally repair my bathroom sink faucet.A little over 30 minutes later, another truck pulled in front of my house with my new water heater. The guy at my house installed it and repaired my faucet, at exactly the same price I was quoted.  I also instructed on what I should consider in the future to bring the rest of the plumbing in my home up to date to avoid emergencies, and I am confident at his level of expertise as my faucet works really, really well now.

Our toilet backed last Friday and so I immediately searched for a plumber. Found Friendly Plumber's good reputation and when I spoke to the receptionist, I was referred to another drain cleaning company, who I was unable to reach, so I called Friendly again.I was told that alternatively, I or someone handy I know can also rent a snake from Home Depot, and it'll solve the problem too.$44 got it done. Thanks for being professional and not hanging up on me, and for all your help!

The gentleman from Friendly Plumber did a great job for me. He was very professional, diagnosed my sewer problem quickly and then fixed it quickly as well.  Yes, the &amp;amp;quot;Friendly&amp;amp;quot; experience was not an inexpensive one. However, I think he realized as much and did not try to weasel me out of my money either. The project was well detailed in writing so I knew exactly what I was being charged, and the exact terms of the transaction. I liked the guarantee on all the work done and that I had no obligation to proceed with the job in the first place just because he looked at our sewer main. Throughout the project, the plumber and the office support I received have been highly professional, which was impressive for such small, local operation.

Friendly Plumber came to my house to look at our water heater and give me an estimate. I wanted a tankless water heater and so this was ordered and we made an appt to come back the Monday after it was supposed to come in to do the work. While working on the heater he noticed another small part to the pipe that needed to be repaired. He did not charge me for that part because he didn't add it into the original estimate. (very honorable) He was very professional and polite. He also had very good communication, leaving messages on both my home and mobile phone with updates as we were waiting for the heater.

I was in a desperate rush for a plumber because my bathroom sink faucet wasn't working. I found Friendly Plumber through searching their reviews, and we first did a telephone 3 way with my dear landlord -- who is tanning in Maui as I write this, to get permission for them to work. This was really helpful in eliminating any questions on my landlord's part, because we're all at least in the same page, and I'm happy my problem was attended to by a professional.Joseph did all the work in less than 3 hours, which really helped free up the rest of my day off. I was given a 4 hour window by another plumber just to show-up, and my hot water dispenser wasn't even going to be installed the same day.Even my landlord is miraculously happy because the plumber's charge was reasonable and all the work is backed up by a warranty.

Joseph is an excellent contractor! He and a helper just finished a full bathroom remodel for me, and installed a tankless hot water heater at my house in 2008. That has been a Godsend to my four kids, and we now have a gorgeous showroom, bragging rights bathroom my wife is so psyched about.Joseph and his helper were very professional and trustworthy. We are very pleased with their quality of work, and excellent attention to detail.

Special respect and many thanks to Joseph, who stuck with our &amp;amp;amp;quot;mystery leak&amp;amp;amp;quot; until it was solved. Gas fireplaces are tricky in that it's a specialty area between plumbing and electrical. Many plumbers can not handle this type of repair. I know because I went through eight seemingly expert companies in the Yellow Pages, and no one could give me any answers. Joseph came to my home a total of 5 times - until the repair was complete. Throughout what could have been an unpleasant and frustrating experience (for me and their company), all employees I have encountered were friendly and professional.

Great mom and pop operation. Fair price, friendly, knowledgeable. Joseph explained what he's doing and how it works. It is very hard to trust contractors these days, but I will only call him from now on. Thank you for being a true professional!

My mother's Victorian developed a bad leak in one of the bathrooms. If there's something that can be said about Victorians is the chain reaction of problems that can happen, once something sets it off.Well, Joseph of Friendly Plumber came over a couple of nights ago, and squeezed us in at the end of his work day and fixed the leak like it was no big deal. My mom said she can tell he is definitely experienced at problem repairs. He was professional, quick and very considerate in what he charged her - not jacking up the price because she's a senior citizen.Thank you from the bottom of my heart. You completely earned this good review, and all our business from now on.

Shout out to Dean and his trainee, wonderful experience!  They came within 30 minutes of my call after we went overnight without toilets and water due to a major back up.  They confirmed the "flushable" toilet wipes really shouldn't be flushed and they caused the issue. They were able to clear the block and were here and gone in about 90 minutes.  Very nice, professional guys.

I have been dealing with this Roto Rooter office for more than 30 years, and they have always been responsive and dependable. I am mystified at the fact that some people have posted a different experience, because EVERYONE who has come to fix my plumbing/drainage problems has been competent, nice and easy to work with. Today Jose came out and was able to fix my problem quite quickly. He provided outstanding service! Roto Rooter has always been prompt, arrived when they said they would, and given me discounts when appropriate. I wouldn't call anyone else.

I couldn’t believe how great my experience was. I live in Concord, CA. My housekeeper was cleaning my bathrooms when the toilets started gurgling and stuff starting coming up in the shower and tub. I called Roto-Rooter explained the problem & they said someone would be at my house within 2 hours. An hour later a water specialist showed up to check to make sure I didn’t have water damage. Billy was extremely friendly and informative. Turns out no water damage. Then Marvin showed up as promised, within the 2 hours. He was also a pleasure to have doing the job. He fixed the issue and didn’t leave a mess. When he told me the price I was surprised how reasonable it was. I will use them again for all my plumbing issues.

One day I noticed there was a leaking valve behind my toilet. When I went to turn it off it began leaking even more. I turned it back on and called Hetherington. They came out the nest day as there was no big hurry. The employee that came to do the repair was very polite when he asked where to find the valve. After about 20 minutes he was done and took the time to explain everything on the invoice before asking me to sign and pay. It was a very nice and simple transaction and I will call on them again.

Professional, courteous, prompt and reliable. Would definitely use this plumbing service again. Graham arrived on time, explained the problem and presented the estimate.  He was able to provide options, on how to fix the issue at a reasonable cost. He took time to explain the various options .Work was completed promptly and he demonstrated what the fix was and that it now had been resolved. I was very pleased with the results, and he made the effort to leave the place clean and tidy. He also answered questions about the new valve, how long it would last and took time to inform me about the warrant process.Plumbing work can be daunting but he was able to be concise and complete work thoroughly. I had tried to reach out to other highly rated Yelp plumbers serving SF and Genteel was the only one who answered right away, setting up the appointment and confirming location immediately.Graham was also good at explaining how to use the new valve appropriately to maintain it and extend use of it. Highly Recommended!

I called Robert's Plumbing for a clogged shower. Robert told me he could be over between 9 and 10 that same day. At 9:10 he was at my door!  Aren't plumbers supposed to be late?  He came in, equiptment in hand, wrote up an invoice for the amount he told me on the phone.  Before long the clog was taken care of , he cleaned up leaving no mess and was gone. That was easy, even gave me a coupon for 10% off any future call.

Carlos came out right away and presented himself in very professional manner. He explained the situation and got to work right away. He completed the job in under 30 minutes gave me a great price and the work is guaranteed for 30 days which is great. I would recommend Carlos and Discount to anyone who needs this type of work done. Thank you! Karen K SFO

I had an issue with a clogged roof drain on an apartment building landing.Ray G. of Roto-Rooter in San Francisco cleaned out the drain, made sure that itwas clear and working properly. He advised me on how to prevent it from happeningagain. Ray could not have been more friendly and helpful. And the best part, he didn'tcharge me a thing for his help and advise. I will gladly pay for his service and expertise for future work at our apartment building. I recommend Ray to anyonewho needs plumbing and drain service. Thank you Ray !John

The only plumbing company I will ever use, period!  They were fast to respond and just as fast in solving my problem (clogged sewer).  I got the sewer snaked and then they put a video camera through the pipeline to make sure it was not broken and then guaranteed the work for six months all for $250.  Ask for Ray, he was very polite and friendly and got it done right.  Thank you Roto-Rooter!  You have a customer for life :)

Needed to do my annual backflow test.  Very reasonable price compared to other testers i've had in the pass.  Seems very efficient and knowledgeable and completed my test with any problems.  What I liked about this place was they were easy to work with my schedule.  They got my test filed and sent me a copy and invoice.  Easy enough.

I had Roto-Rooter declog a shower drain.  In the process a small leak  was generated.  I can't say enough positives about the prompt response by the RR team to address, plumber & water restoration tech.  I was particularly pleased with Jose Garcia, Lead Technician on the water restoration process.  Thank you all for handling this issue with your expertise.  I will definitely use your company again, should the need arise.

We had leaking pipe under our sink that was a nightmare, the way the pipe was initially installed was just wrong. We paid $280 to our first plumber and $375 to plumber #2, both tried their hands at "re-running" and "repairing" but neither of their "fixes" held.  Within a week the leak returned and required a larger pan under the sink after each attempt. Putting aside our weariness of corporate plumbers we call Roto-Rooter,  coupon in hand. Greg from the Palo Alto facility arrived right on time and after a 5 minute inspection (plumbers 1 and 2 both spent in excess of half an hour), he clearly explained the flaw in our layout, and his recommendation to "fix" the problem. The repair was done at a cost well below the private plumbers and in a third of the time.  We were skeptical to say the least, but Greg was knowledgeable, professional and confident. So, we gave him the benefit of the doubt and waited... After a month of waiting and watching we finally removed the drip pan! It has been over 3 months and we have officially stopped checking for moisture. Roto-Rooter is who we strongly recommend and if you are fortunate enough to get a guy named Greg, please tell him the skeptics said, Thanks!

Hands down for a plumbing service they provide the best customer service. From the initial phone call to the follow through from the office to the technicians. It's not easy to find in a plumbing service. The technicians do what's required and communicate if there are any problems. I've been a happy customer for 6 years.

Waited almost 4 hours with no sign of the plumber in sight.  What was only a clogged drain became an emergency when 4 precious hours were wasted.  Now there are only two hours left to find another plumber and to make dinner before the guests arrive.  Could have done the job myself but though it would be more convenient to hire someone.  Cannot even go to hardware store now to buy supplies to the the job because it is so late in the day.  Have to call for updates to find out what time plumber will show up.  Was not stressed over the clogged drain, but is now pissed that so much time was wasted and the result was ZERO.

San Diego Social Services, especially Joanna Huntsberger, are horrible people. God forbid your social worker has a quota to meet in adoptions. You will lose your child especially when people like Joanna huntsberger lie to you and tell you that the adoptive parents will never take your child away. However, in the LIE of open adoption that Joanna huntsberger told, 13 years later I am still without my son. Women like her are promoted for meeting their adoptive quotas, instead of reprimanded for lying to birthmothers. This is not a justice system. This is a system for social workers are taught to take babies. AKA legalized kidnapping. And Joanna huntsberger is one of the worst most underhanded comma and disgusting social workers that ever lived on the face of this planet. I would avoid social services at all costs.

Bought a motor home in Fresno, CA on 7/21/18. From the very first day that we picked it up, it was nothing but problems. It was even crashed while being on the dealership's grounds for repairs. We looked for different attorneys for 5 months. During that time, we mailed the dealership and the manufacturer many letters and got no response. We then paid for an attorney that was $750.00 just for them to write a letter to the dealership. Once the attorney did that, the dealership finally responded but with a negative result. We then found the offices of Jon Jacobs and gave them a call. The first person we talked to was miss Guisela. We were very surprised as to how she explained everything to us. She was very informative, friendly, and professional. Best of all, she spoke Spanish, as well as Shawn and Michael. Every time we had a question, they were very quick to answer. Our problem was resolved within 6 months. Our vehicle was bought back from the manufacturer and all expenses were returned to us. We were not charged a cent. This office deserves a 10 star rating. They have a great staff. We are very lucky to have found them. Now we believe that there are such attorneys that help out without charging.We appreciate them. Very well recommended.

I had the privilege of working with the office of Jon Jacobs, whom defended my case against Ford. In less he 8 months they were able to negotiate a buyback and got me a remarkable settlement. I highly recommend them, since I can guarantee that they will fight for your case and help you to obtain the best results they can, regarding your case. In a scale from 1-10 with 10 being excellent, I give them an 11! ☺ Yes, they will go above and beyond, exceeding your expectations. It is my opinion that Jon Jacobs and his wonderful group of people including Rene Dupart and Kayla Geottman deserve an A+++++++++!

Working in this field for as long as I have, I’ve grown to distrust recruitment companies. They’re never straightforward with you and don’t give you the positions you’d be interested in. With BCG search reviews that is a thing of the past.

Not many job portals help you understand the market. There are certain things to focus on in interview and job applications that they just get. They made the path to a new position so much smoother for me.

After I was contacted by a recruiter at the BCG Search, I found her to be not only responsive but she also motivated me and assured me of a successful future. Now, I have an interview on Friday, and I am confident that I will succeed.

My friend just got a job through them, and thanked me for referring this company to them. It is always a pleasure seeing a service that you recommended, living up to the hype that you created.

I had a great connection with Karen and can say without a doubt that I haven’t met a recruiter like her before. Recruiters nowadays seem like they are following a script. And, here I had Karen who would call me up herself and give me tips before interviews. What a wonderful lady.

My experience at Walkup, Melodia and Kelly was positive every step of the way. My lawyer, Doug Saeltzer, was extremely knowledgeable, ethical and professional, and he had a genuine concern for me, my family and for my case. Doug took the time to explain my options and he let me make my own decisions, after explaining processes and potential outcomes. My case was settled and everything turned out the way we discussed. I could not have asked for a better lawyer or a better result.

I found this firm to be highly experienced and knowledgeable.  No other firm I interviewed spent the time with me that this firm did in detailing my options and best course of action regarding my case.  Fortunately, my case did not end up in trial,  but I chose this firm because of their years of winning in the courtroom and not being afraid of a trial.

Donald at Accident Attorney's Group has been wonderful.  I was referred by a friend who had a good experience & he was attentive and reassuring during my complimentary consult.  I have confidence he will represent me with integrity in my case.  The other employees I have interacted with have exemplified the same level of customer service.  Thank you for making this very stressful time, less stressful.

Susan Lee was my accident lawyer. She was awesome. She always took all my calls and answered all my questions patiently and thoroughly. She referred me to a doctor that I felt really took care of me and I just couldn't have asked for someone better to take me through the scary process of healing from a car accident. Thank you, Susan! I hope I don't need you again but if I get in another accident you will be the first person I call!

Loan Lending was incredibly easy to work with.  For every step of the way to our refinancing, they were responsive and their instructions were clear.  Being able to do everything online alleviated any concerns of the pandemic. I had a low credit score of 501 with a couple of negative items, I got approved for a mortgage loan of $72k and the interest was fair enough! Kudos to the entire Loan Lending team, and a special mention for David who made it all happen. Contact ''LoanLending  at  Cash4U  dot   Com'' if you need any kind of loan.

I had the experience of working with Murlene on my case in San Francisco for discrimination.  The case involved me being discriminated because of my sexual orientation in which I believe is my freedom of choice.  I was harrassed at work and away from work by employees and people associated wit the business.  I am safe to say now I have moved on to a new job and awarded for my emotional distress and punititive damge. Thank You Murlene for fighting for my rights! We deserve to live without fear of who we love or like to meet.

Murlene Randle Law - San Francisco Discrimination & Civil Rights LawyerPleased to have dealt with Murlene Randle on my San Francisco Discimination case.  I was discriminated because of my sexual preference.  Living in San Francisco you would think this kind of stuff doesn't happen but this is a constant struggle.  I would like to commend Murlene Randle out of San Francisco for helping me take my case and fighting for my civil rights.  From the beginning this was an uphill fight and because a very grueling case for both of us.  My case lasted for sometime for us to gather evidence but at the end we suceeded in winning my case.  I won a judgement of alot of money for all the damage that had been done to me. I hight recommend Murlene Randle out of San Francisco for all your discrimination needs. http://sanfranciscodiscriminationlawyers.com

I am so grateful to be able to work with Jenny Schwartz of Outten and Golden.  She is not only highly competent and proficient but also caring and understanding.  She took the time review my situation, talked me through my options and provided guidance throughout the process.  She would keep my appraised of the progress and was always available for any questions.  Her expertise enabled me to make informed decisions.And just as important, Jenny was understanding and empathetic to me and my situation.  In a very short period of time, she built trust and made me feel safe.  Not only did I feel that I had a highly skillful lawyer but moreover, an ally.  These situations are never easy but I knew I was in capable hands with Jenny and Outten & Golden.

Saw Connie Francis here last year.  It's still a grand old theater.  I hope she's still around when I'm old.  The only minus is the parking -- very difficult to find in the Castro/Market Street area.

The Castro theater is the oldest theater in California, the seats are cramped, the sound is marginal and the screen is smaller than modern ones - yet the experience of seeing ANY film at the Castro beats any other movie-going experience available!  Get that popcorn with REAL butter and enjoy the experience of a movie at the Castro!  I simply cannot describe how extraordinary this theater is!

I had my previous two older dogs with Dr Singla. We were happy with their treatment. Now I have my new puppy with him and I am really happy with him giving me a good explanation for why my puppy will not eat puppy food and throws up what she does eat. He gave her very good care.

My 3 year old German Sheperd, Zohan was experiencing intense itching until I met Dr. Singla at Ocean Ave Veterinary Hospital.  I took him to several different veterinarians, because no one could diagnose his condition. Someone was diagnosing food allergy, environmental allergy, immune disorder.  They put Zohan on several different kind of foods, and medicine.  I ended up spending more than $3000 in vet bills.  One day I went to Dr. Singla, he did one blood work for thyroid panel, first I was thinking not to do blood work because of cost, but when he told me all the signs of the condition that was similiar to Zohan's symptoms, I agreed to test for Thyroid function. Next day Dr. Singla called me without any delay that my dog has hyperthyroid condition and we started on medication for this condition.  Again Zohan is feeling great and enjoying his life.  Dr. Singla is great, kind and compassionate.  I will recommend Dr. Singla to everyone.  Thanks Dr. Singla!!!

VCA and Dr. Kristine Chan almost killed my cat. I am suing them in Small Claims Court for $10K for Veterinary malpractice; Fraud; Emotional distress; Breach of contract; etc. What should have been a straightforward hyperthyroidism case costing less than $1000 and with a rapid recovery, turned into a months-long nightmare for which I was charged more than $5000. Imagine how shocked I was to discover, months later, after applying my own research to the situation, that we actually had a simple problem with what should have been a simple solution. Harvey was not hopeless and did not need expensive and stressful echocardiograms and other expensive treatments that had been pushed on me. What Harvey needed was a proper dosage of the thyroid medication, methimazole. When Harvey finally got a higher dosage, the other problems started to resolve. Don't go here.

DO NOT USE!!!  He can groom most of the time, last cut was crooked with more hair above one eye then the other.  He gives you a time for an appointment and puts your PET IN A CAGE FOR HOURS!!!  This last and I mean last time we ever use him, we dropped off our Airedale at 11:00, at 1:50 we get a call that he had a family emergency and only got as far as washing her and we needed to pick her up...$65 for what I could have done at home...DONE DONE DONE!!!  WILL NEVER SEE A PENNY FROM US AGAIN!!!

As a Emeryville resident I heard good reviews about this dog spa and wanted to bring my baby (dog) in for some spa treatment services. I scheduled and appointment and dropped him off at 9AM on Friday morning. Advised the technician that I would like an 1/2 cut with an oatmeal bath. This was my 6th time there and even though the last time I had him there for a bath he left with a bleeding paw but wanted to give them an opportunity to redeem themselves. Called at 3pm and they advised that he was not ready and would be ready at 5:30 (even though I dropped him off at 9am). Got there at 5:35 and he was still being groomed as I could see him as I walked in. I paid the receptionist and patiently wait for him to be ready. I noticed that the technician was being very rough with him but thought perhaps he was just excited to see me. Once they brought him out I realized his cut was not what I asked for but was so upset that he had been there for 9hrs and was ready to go. Once we got into my car I noticed blood all over the seats. HIS PAWS were bleeding again. Went back in and advised them as blood was all over their floors and even the receptionist noticed and even said "Wow they must have cut his nail too low". The Owner then comes out and says "Let me put some powder on it to stop it". I asked her why does this always happen as i was furious and she advised that when dogs see their owner they get excited and increases their blood pressure which makes their nail bleed. MADE NO DAMN SENSE!!! She was extremely insensitive and unapologetic about the situation. I then learned from an employee there that the dog was in the cage for 85% of the time while being in their facility. I would never EVER!!! take him back there and i would advise everyone to do the same. I have talked to 3 other customers with similar experiences.

I was referred to this salon by my daughter. The groomer is an exceptionally great stylist, my dog always comes back to me smelling good and looking beautiful. Nails clip, ears clean, hair cut and brush to a brilliant shine. Xena my dog always seems to be in a good playful mood when I go to retreive her. All About the Dogue Salon and Spa has a very clean and friendly atmosphere. The staff is great friendly and outgoing. I am always greeted with a smile the service is beyond what I expected from a groomer. I am a happy satisfied customer and so is my dog.

Amazing real estate agent: Viktor assisted my us in both buying our current townhouse and selling our condo. Withing the allotted period, both homes are successfully sold and acquired. Due to his thorough understanding of the housing market and excellent bargaining abilities, he was able to make both happen within a short period. Understandably, he is so busy given the volume of clients he sees.

They were great to work with when we decided to sell our house and our income property. They were able to help us decide what we needed to do to the house to get the best return on our investment. They also helped us find our home. They were professional, prompt, and easy to work with.

Amazing! They were beyond great to work with. As a first-time home buyer with no idea what I was doing, they made the process easier than easy. They always took the time to explain the steps and keep me informed as the process went on. With their combined knowledge and experience, they were able to help me find my house and get into it with no hassle. If you want a smooth and great team to work with, this is it.

When we were getting ready to leave LA, Viktor and his crew made the process of looking for homes surprisingly simple. They were able to identify the essential elements of our lifestyle requirements when we relocated to a new city, and they found us the ideal area that turned out to be a terrific fit. They also made a stressful process enjoyable, as if that weren't enough. Without a doubt, we would collaborate with them again. I respect that in any business because it shows that they are committed to their clients' long-term enjoyment and to excelling in what they do. We should all give these wonderful people high fives!

I worked with Makras Real Estate Company on selling my existing home as well as purchasing a new home. They were great to work with; they were always positive and professional. I was able to sell my home very quickly.

I would highly recommend working with Makras Real Estate.

I can't thank Viktor enough for his assistance. I admire his sincerity, and he provided us with excellent suggestions on how to present our home and make the selling process as painless as possible.

Viktor and Judy went above and beyond to make sure everything was crossed and dotted, and they were with us at every step of the process. This was extremely helpful, especially since we had recently relocated to a different state. We would not have been able to sell the condo if it hadn't been for them. I can't say enough good things about them, and I would recommend them to anyone looking to buy or sell a home in San Francisco.

I couldn't think of a better way to describe him.

Working with Viktor and the entire Makras Real Estate team was the best decision I ever made. We had little experience of the home buying process as first-time home buyers, but Viktor soothed our fears and guided us through each stage of the process.

I had a fantastic time with Viktor Makras. As a first-time homeowner, Viktor and his team took the time to explain the entire process from beginning to end. They allotted time in the afternoon to do showings in the areas I was interested in so they could get a sense of my style, price range, and so on. Thank you so much for all of your hard work and assistance!

We were lucky to have Makras Real Estate handle a condo sale on our behalf. Victor's assistance was vital, and his experience and professionalism are at the absolute top, from setting up the house for showings (which resulted in many offers within days of listing), leveraging his listing channels access, explaining and negotiating offers and contract details, and so on. We are incredibly satisfied with how things turned out and would enthusiastically suggest he and his entire staff to anyone wanting to buy or sell a home.

We are currently residing in a Chicago IL western suburb, and recently bought a second property as an investment in the Northern California Area.  After having done my research, I came across Short Sale Specialist at Century 21, Joel Fletes.  I contacted him just to get an idea, and was immediately ositively impacted by his service and personality.  Needless to say that I was pleased to see what was available, how far our dollars could go under this market conditions, and the investment potential in some of these properties being offered.  After discussing the options, we went ahead and decided in a duplex property in the Colma/Daly City area.  At first we were a little nervous, and rightfully so being that we were not near the property, and were concerned about the traveling back and forth not just to physically look at the properties, but to actually work out the details and all the paperwork involved.  I must say that Joel was able to bring us at ease minimizing the traveling, by keeping us informed at all times, and in constant communication not just electronically, but by phone.  We were pleasantly surprised by how smooth the whole process took place!  We closed last month and have already started to make money in our investment this month!  Our only regret was that we did not contacted Joel before, he was much more knowledgeable and on top of his game, much more so than the agent we worked with to buy our residence here in IL a few years back (sorry Anthony).  I would highly recommend Joel in a heartbeat, and will definitely work with him in the near future to grow our real estate investments in CA.  This is the time.  THANK YOU JOEL!

We worked with Joel to buy our first house and it was a very pleasant experience. Joel is a down-to-earth, hard-working and knowledgeable real estate agent. He has a great deal of experience both selling and buying houses so he knows the answer to pretty much any real estate question and his advise is always honest. Joel uses his knowledge and experience to get the best for his clients. He ensured that the seller of our house completed all necessary inspections and he also asked the seller to purchase a 1-year home warranty for us as part of the closing package. Despite the fact that we were rather indecisive and picky buyers, we never felt like Joel was pushing us to make a decision. On the contrary, he was very patient and always gave us all the positive and negative facts. We also had tons of questions and Joel answered every single one and even did research to make sure we made completely informed decisions. Even though we're first-time buyers, we have worked with other real estate agents in the past who have helped our family members purchase homes and Joel is really one of a kind. He even recommended an excellent mortgage loan specialist to us (who is just as thorough and dedicated as Joel) so our entire transaction was fully taken care of and went very smoothly. We wouldn't work with anyone else but Joel and always recommend him to all our family and friends looking to buy/sell their house.

As a first time buyer, I looked for many months for properties and worked with many real estate agents that promised that they can get me what I wanted.  After bidding on many properties and getting outbidded, I almost gave up.  I saw one of his listing and he seemed like a pretty nice guy, so I gave him a chance.  He is straight with you, knows house values and gave me some really good advice.  I finally won a bid after many months of searching.  Thank you!!!

We bought a house through Realtor, Joel Fletes. He was referred to us by a friend who also bought a house with his help. Joel is very knowledgeable,responsive,honest and most of all shows a lot of integrity. He was able to negotiate the price on asked the seller to helped us with the closing costs that we really needed to close the deal. He is thorough in explaining all the paperwork that is needed such the regulatory disclosures and inspections reports.

We are very satisfied with his help and will strongly recommend him to our friends, co-workers and family members.

We highly recommend Joel Fletes as an outstanding Realtor from Century 21 Imperial Realty in whom you can place your unqualified trust, we feel he handled the sale like a true professional,he gave us good advice about listing the property and protected our interests all stages of negotiations, he is a great negotiator, he demonstrated an expertise in realty knowledge that my husband and I had not seen with other Realtors. Of all the Realtors we have worked with, either buying or selling, none were as professional, considerate,honest as him. He showed his expertise and professionalism in handling the open houses and final closing on the property we called home for 20 years. He never hesitated to go the extra mile, or make the extra phone call to insure our peace of mind with regards to purchase or sales. You can always reach him at 650-219-1034Sincerely

I recently came in to check out the duboce apartments and was pleasantly surprised. I had a look with mahoty (spelling might be totally wrong) but she was amazing. She took time to show me around all of the apartments I was thinking about and I think we found the perfect one. But, to anything there are pros and cons and I'd like to be transparent...Pros: LOCATIONsuper nice staffamazing buildingZipcar downstairs for residentsfree bike parkingsuper modern and unique interior designapartments are brand newAMAZING appliancesthe roof - SERIOUSLY, THE ROOF!!Cons: not a lot of parking availablepricing is a little higher than the others nearbySpa is still being completedno one signed up for commercial space yet (that they can say)Overall, this is the best community all around I have been to yet. Aside from the final touches still being done (which is normal in a brand new spot) the staff make you feel welcomed and at home. I'm definitely going to be signing a lease with Duboce soon! Definitely would reccomend!

I've been living in the duboce triangle for 5 years and I watched the building go up while passing it on my way to work each day. As my lease is coming up at my current place, I went in to get information on the building and was pleasantly surprised! The staff was extremely helpful and the apartments are beautiful. For about the same price that I'm paying at my current place, I'm getting so much more. The roof is awesome with great views of corona heights and the private homes in the hillside. There's a pretty large fireplace and barbecues for the residents to use. Parking costs additional but fortunately I just have a bike (there's free bike parking underground). I think I'm most excited about the hot tub! Overall I'm excited to make the move and live in something brand new and more modern!

this is absolutely the best apartments Ive ever lived in. After living in a few luxury complexes around sf I decided to make the move closer to the castro. I couldnt be any happier! The roof is my favorite place to hang out, and the staff is beyond amazing. I cant wait to spend the future here!

Rose Nadonza from Climb helped sell my house. She is one of the hardest working people in the business. She will treat you like family, and work as hard as she can for you. If you are going to sell or buy a house I recommend you to go with her. If I was ever going to sell or buy again she would be the first person I would call in a heartbeat.

INCREDIBLE experience with Rose. Her value is a great balance of professional & personable. Real estate selling and buying is not for the faint of heart. It's emotional, thrilling, heartbreaking. Rose made this whole process easier for me. I have worked with two other agents in the past prior to Rose & she easily went above my expectations. She's a little force to be reckoned with because she's very knowledgeable, aggressive at the right times, and a determined. I was kept in the know the entire time and was provided top notch service. More than 5 stars, thank you thank you.

Rose is a true professional and was on top of everything from the very start to end. She's very knowledgeable and made it a priority to keep us updated at all times. She also is a great resource to contractors, design, and overall advice.

This is one of the few web sites that not only has real estate listings but also ahs extensive filters to help narrow down searches by description and by neighborhood!It also has foreclosure listing information! It's great to be able to sift through a narrower range of preferences than going through hundreds of inappropriate properties like many search sites.

NeighborCity is an irresponsible company that continues to publish erroneous information about my real estate business despite my numerous attempts to correct it through communications with NeighborCity.  I have offered the folks at NeighborCity documentation to support my claim that the information they are publishing is in error, but they appear to have zero interest in correcting their mistake.  Bottom line: don't necessarily believe what you read on NeighborCity.com - if the NeighborCity folks are that  careless with the information they're providing about me, they're likely to be equally careless with the information they're providing about other agents.
