No, look, this is about having folks in Washington, DC, that put New Hampshire first. Was the election stolen? Of course it wasn’t stolen.

The committee found that the Organization charged the Secret Service “excessive nightly rates on dozens of trips” as high as $1,185 per night despite claims by the former company that federal employees traveling with him would stay at those properties “for free” or “at cost.” “The exorbitant rates charged to the Secret Service and agents’ frequent stays at Trump-owned properties raise significant concerns about the former self-dealing and may have resulted in a taxpayer-funded windfall for former Trump’s struggling businesses,” the panel’s chairwoman, New York Rep. Carolyn Maloney, wrote in a letter to the service’s director on Monday.\n",

      "The economy and inflation are the dominant issues three weeks out from the midterm congressional elections, challenging chances of maintaining control of Congress, according to a string of new polls released in the last few days. Widespread impressions of the economy as bad and worsening, combined with dissatisfaction with Joe and the way things are going in the country, suggest that the nation’s overall political mood – which had been somewhat more favorable for following the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade – may be tilting more in favor. A CBS News/YouGov survey released Sunday finds 65% of voters feel the economy is getting worse and 68% say the administration could be doing more to combat inflation. In a New York Times/Siena College poll released Monday, 64% of likely voters say the United States is heading in the wrong direction, with the economy (26%) and inflation (18%) the only issues named by double-digit shares of likely voters as the most important problem facing the country today, with all other issues at 8% or less. And 70% of registered voters say they are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the US today, according to an AP-NORC survey out Monday, including majorities across party lines.\n",

That financial gap is being filled by the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC affiliated with Senate Minority Leader Mitch according to data from AdImpact, an advertising tracking firm. With more than $196 million invested on the airwaves and online so far, the Senate Leadership Fund is by far the largest TV and digital advertiser this fall in six of the 10 states deemed most likely to flip by CNN — Georgia, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin. It’s hard to overstate the effect the super PAC has single-handedly made on advertising in the final two months of the elections.

While history’s judgments take decades, it is already clear that the two terms of the first Black triggered a backlash that has shaped America ever since. He was, after all, succeeded by Trump, who got his political start by authoring a racist and false conspiracy theory that was not born in the United States. The current conservative Supreme Court majority dragging the country to the right owes much to the refusal of Senate to grant a pick for the top bench that was his constitutional prerogative.

      "In the final month of the midterm election season, candidates have made crime central to their closing message. In Nevada, Senate nominee Adam Laxalt is running an ad touting police groups who have flipped from endorsing his opponent, Sen. Catherine Cortez in 2018 to him in 2022. In Wisconsin, Sen. Johnson has spent millions tying his challenger, Lt. Mandela Barnes, to efforts to defund the police and called him “dangerously liberal on crime.” And in gubernatorial contests in Pennsylvania and New York, candidates and outside groups have used graphic crime video in campaign ads – including clips from outside the states they hope to represent. With control of Congress and governors’ mansions on the line, now are placing nearly as much emphasis on rising violent crime across the country as they have on the economy for over a year. This lasered-in focus has forced campaigns – many of which have spent the last few months focused on abortion as the dominant issue motivating voters – to defend their records and push back against leveraging of high-profile crimes against them.\n",

The nomination of polarizing candidates aligned with the former in key swing states, including Georgia, New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, has complicated the ability to appeal to more moderate and independent voters in Senate and governors races across the country.\n",

Twenty-two months on, a Washington, DC, jury shored up the breaches in the country’s democracy on Tuesday, with a monumental verdict against right-wing insurrectionists. But while the courts – and voters in the midterm elections – have reaffirmed the rule of law, a furor over ex-President Trump’s meeting with a White supremacist Holocaust denier is underlining just how fragile it remains.

Some albeit tentatively and often with self-protecting caveats, are beginning to test whether the political incentives for criticizing the ex-president could outweigh the hazards. This trend is obvious in reactions from ex-Vice Mike and some top lawmakers over dinner at his Florida resort last week with White supremacist Nick Fuentes. It was also visible earlier this month in critiques of the ex-president after many of his election-denying, neophyte candidates flamed out in the midterm elections and suggested that he could again doom in a general election in 2024. At the same time, however, the growing clout of radical, pro-Trump members of the new House majority, which takes over in January – and the reality that leader Kevin hopes of being speaker may rely on patronage – demonstrates his still robust influence. That dynamic was on show on Tuesday after emerged from a meeting at the White House with congressional leaders and condemned Fuentes and his rhetoric, but misleadingly implied that had also repeatedly condemned his guest as well.\n",

The former absorbed a stunning defeat at the Supreme Court over his long-running campaign to hide his tax returns, which are now set to land before a Democratic-run House committee. Republican-appointed appeals court judges, meanwhile, appeared cool to his latest bid to slow the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case. A New York judge set an October 2023 trial date for the state’s $250 million case alleging fraud against three of his children and his organization, which will fall just before presidential primary season.

Given massive legal exposure, and habit of using the courts’ deliberative pace to postpone accountability, it’s not unusual for him to have a tough time on the same day in simultaneously running cases.\n",

The returns, long shrouded in secrecy, were released to the public on Friday by the House Ways and Means Committee, the culmination of a battle over their disclosure that went to the Supreme Court. They confirm a report issued from the Joint Committee on Taxation that claimed large losses before and throughout his presidency that he carried forward to reduce or practically eliminate his tax burden. For example, his returns show that he carried forward a $105 million loss in 2015 and $73 million in 2016. The thousands of pages of documents from the former personal and business federal tax returns – which spanned the years 2015 through 2020 – provide a complex web of raw data about finances, offering up many questions about his wealth and income that could be pursued both by auditors and political opponents.\n",

But it appears the administration may end up with some more time to consider its plans after Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on Monday issued a temporary hold on the order lifting the policy. A surge of migrants at the US-Mexico border in recent days has already raised alarm among and some of whom have called on the White House to find a way to extend the restrictions, and has placed immigration – a politically precarious issue – back at the forefront. The White House has said the administration is bound by a court order.\n",

      "The expected move by the January 6 committee to formally ask the Department of Justice to prosecute former Donald over his role in the US Capitol insurrection will make history, whether or not charges are ever brought. The committee, which saw its mission as essential to saving US democracy, will hold a last public meeting and is expected to call on the Justice Department to charge and potentially some allies over his attempt to overturn the 2020 election in one of the darkest periods in modern politics. Criminal referrals would be a symbolic move since the committee has no power to initiate legal proceedings itself. The Justice Department has its own federal investigation into January 6, 2021, now overseen by a special counsel. But, if merited by troves of evidence collected in hundreds of interviews and a summer of dramatic televised hearings, referrals would represent a moment of stark accountability for January 6. The historic recommendation of a prosecution against an ex-president would also lay down a marker for future elections and renegade presidents after an attack on democracy with no parallel.\n",

The seven-page document, which states that DHS inherited a “broken and dismantled immigration system,” was published online this week and appears to be an updated version of the plan the department issued in April – the last time Title 42 was scheduled to be lifted. At the time, a federal judge blocked the lifting of the Trump-era public health rule that allows federal immigration agents to swiftly return migrants to Mexico or their home countries. According to the document, the surge of resources to the southern border includes the hiring of nearly 1,000 Border Patrol processing coordinators and adding 2,500 contractors and personnel from government agencies – which allows federal agents to focus on field law enforcement duties.\n",

      "A Manhattan jury has found two Organization companies guilty on multiple charges of criminal tax fraud and falsifying business records connected to a 15-year scheme to defraud tax authorities by failing to report and pay taxes on compensation for top executives. The Corp. and Payroll Corp. were found guilty on all charges they faced. Trump and his family were not charged in this case, but the former was mentioned repeatedly during the trial by prosecutors about his connection to the benefits doled out to certain executives, including company-funded apartments, car leases and personal expenses.\n",

On the same day, his hand-picked candidate lost a winnable Senate race in a red state. The House January 6 committee has decided to make criminal referrals to the Justice Department – possibly of him or his close associates. And his call to terminate the Constitution has once again backed into a corner. So many premature political obituaries have been written for that it would be foolish to write him off as he embarks on his third consecutive White House bid.\n",

      "A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit against Saudi Arabia’s crown prince after the administration recommended he be granted immunity in the case brought against him by the fiancée of murdered Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Judge John Bates said in an opinion that despite his “uneasiness,” the US government told the DC District Court that Prince Mohammed bin Salman is immune since he also holds the title of prime minister and so he is “entitled to head of state immunity.” That unease was not only due to the prince’s involvement in Khashoggi’s murder, the judge wrote, but also the timing of his appointment as prime minister of Saudi Arabia. Bin Salman, known as MBS, was only made prime minister – and therefore the technical head of the government – in late September in what observers saw as a ploy to secure head of government immunity in the lawsuit brought by Hatice Cengiz and Khashoggi’s advocacy group DAWN.\n",

The poll from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs found that most Americans still support aiding Ukraine – 65% support sending weapons, 66% support economic aid, 75% support increasing sanctions on Russia, and 73% support accepting Ukrainian refugees to the US. The administration has sent roughly $20 billion in assistance to Ukraine, as of last month, and 40% of respondents to the new poll say the US should “maintain its current level of support for Ukraine indefinitely,” rather than intervening militarily in support of Ukraine or gradually withdrawing US support.\n",

It’s an issue confronting House Leader Kevin who is rounding up the votes to win the House speaker race and facing pressure from some of his colleagues to more forcefully detail how he plans to handle the sensitive topic before they decide whether to support him on January 3 for the most powerful position in Congress. In interviews with CNN, more than two dozen House lawmakers laid out their demands to avoid the nation’s first-ever debt default, ranging from new immigration policies to imposing deep domestic spending cuts. And several flatly said they would oppose raising the borrowing limit even if all their demands were met, making narrow path even narrower.\n",

Sen. Raphael was the leading vote-getter in the November general election, over nominee Herschel Walker, but he fell short of the majority need to win the race outright. Now it’s a one-on-one contest and both parties have gone all-in to boost their ranks in the Democratic-controlled Senate and send a message ahead of the 2024 presidential election, when Georgia could again be a decisive swing state. The spending by campaigns and aligned outside groups has been stratospheric and turnout, despite the state’s new election laws allowing for fewer days of early voting, was robust ahead of Tuesday’s election.\n",

      "The highly touted red wave in last month’s midterm election failed to develop largely because it hit a wall of resistance among independent voters, especially across the key battleground states. And that presents difficult questions for looking forward to 2024. The disappointing showing among independents this year marked the third consecutive election in which the party has underperformed with those critical swing voters. Although Trump ran competitively among independents in his first presidential race in 2016, since he took office, the has consistently faced broad opposition among them, especially those who are women or hold four-year college degrees. The 2022 struggles with independents were especially striking because they came even as most of those voters expressed negative views of both Joe job performance and the state of the economy – sentiments that typically cause most swing voters to break for the party out of the White House. To many analysts in both parties, the reluctance of so many independents to support candidates despite such discontent underscores how powerfully the Trump-era has alienated these voters.\n",
